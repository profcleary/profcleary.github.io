<ul>
<li> Final exam will be in Marshak MR2, Monday Dec 22 1:00-3:15pm. Seat assignments TBA.
<li> Some WeBWork assignment deadlines postponed.

<li>
 There are several sources of potential final exam questions to help prepare:
 <ul>
<li> The <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213</a> page has 3 Sample Finals.
<li> The <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-20300/">Math 203</a></strong> page has 17 old 203 finals, which cover many of the topics we have (from lines and planes up to triple integrals in spherical coordinates) and some topics we do not (sequences and series.)
<li> The <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-39200/">Math 392</a></strong> has 7 old 392 finals,  which cover many of the topics we have (line integrals, work integrals, vector fields, conservative vector fields, and Green's Theorem) and some topics we do not (surface integrals, Gauss' and Stokes' Theorems, and linear algebra.)
<li> Our Brightspace page has a document with 200+ sample questions on 213 topics.
</ul>


<li> Exam 3 graded, scores on Gradescope.  You may want to estimate your prospects in the class using  <a href="whatDoINeedOnThe213Final.html">this grade estimator</a>, phrased in terms of what is needed on the final.  Regrade requests open for Exam 3 for one week.


<li> The Math 21300 group final examination is scheduled for Monday, December 22nd, from 1:00PM – 3:15PM.  The room will be announced later (it will not be our usual room) but at least we have a time now. There are old departmental sample finals on the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213 page</a>.

</ul>
If you expect to need to leave briefly during the exam, you should opt for the two-part option. No student who arrives later than 15 minutes after the exam begins may choose the two-part option. No one-part exam student may leave until one hour has elapsed.

If you are interested in the two-part exam option, let me know by email by at least
one week before the exam so that I can duplicate exams appropriately.

<li> Introductory quiz "Quiz1" is available on Brightspace and is due Sept 9th.


<li> We will be using the WeBWorK assignment system for homework which is at
<a href="https://webwork.ccny.cuny.edu/webwork2/25_Fa213_KL""> https://webwork.ccny.cuny.edu/webwork2/25_Fa213_KL </a> part of the <a href="https://webwork.ccny.cuny.edu/webwork2">CCNY WeBWorK</a> system

To log in there, use your CCNY account information (what you would use to connect to the wireless network or the CCNY email student email system) without the @citymail.cuny.edu, same password.  There are already a few assignments posted there so you check make sure that you can log in and begin to familiarize yourself with the system.  If you are not able to connect to the system, you may need to visit the CCNY Helpdesk and reset your password there.

Note: to login to the WeBWorK system, use just the username part of your login, and not the @citymail.cuny.edu part.


<li> Students enrolled in the course as of August  should have received a 213 welcome email.  Please check your registration and email settings if you believe you are enrolled in the course but have not gotten such an email.

<li> First lecture is Tuesday, Aug 26th, in NAC 1/203, which is toward the left (southeast) after entering the main entrance near the flagpoles on the NAC Plaza from Convent Ave.


<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Brightspace discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.

<li> Introductory quizes "Quiz0" "Quiz 1" are available on Brightspace and should be completed by Sept 9th.


<li> Our class will meet in NAC 1/203 in the North Academic Center, on the first floor.  You can head left from the plaza entry near the flagpoles.  

<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Brightspace discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.


<li> Review quiz on quadric surfaces is  available on Brightspace and is due Sept 9th.  Note that you will also need to submit photos or images of handwritten
work (in this case, sketches) as supporting material on Brightspace, under "Assignments/Supporting Work for Quadric Surface quiz"

<li> Introductory quiz "Quiz0" is  available on Brightspace and is due Sept 9th.



<li> We will be using the WeBWorK system for electronic homework, but it is important to get in the habit of working out exercises clearly and completely by hand.  Furthermore, note that the electronic system does not test many important aspects of the course, including knowing the definitions, theorems, and proofs, as well as geometric aspects such as sketching both in the plane and in space.  

<li> The video lessons from the old Math 203 course which overlaps 213 considerably are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">here</a>. To review prerequisite material, you may want to consider Lesson 7 "Cylinders" and Lesson 8 "Quadric Surfaces" which were covered in Math 212.


<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213 page</a> which may be helpful.

<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201, 202, and 203.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a review or supplement.
<li> For those who took a course comparable to Math 212 elsewhere or a while ago, there
is a range of information available about current CCNY Math 212 <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">here</a> including syllabi, assignments, and sample departmental final exams.
<li> Sample departmental finals from Math 213 are available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">here</a>.
