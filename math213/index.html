<strong>Announcements: </strong>


<ul>
<li> Exam 3 graded, scores on Gradescope.  I wanted to get students as much information as needed to decide about withdrawing before the deadline.
<li> Blackboard quiz available about end-of-term.
<li> The final exam will be Monday, May 20th, 1:00-3:15pm in Marshak MR2.  Seats are assigned at <a href="seats.html">this page</a>.
<li> Note that the final exam date and time are the same for all 213 sections.&nbsp; The final exam time is not based on course meeting time, unlike it is for many CCNY courses.

<li> Final exam will be Monday, May 20th, 1:00-3:15pm in Marshak 2.  Final exam seating will be assigned soon.

<li> Note that access to campus requires a current registration sticker.  For students without a current registration sticker, the ID office in NAC 1/206 sent email about their hours, which are Mon-Thurs 10am-2pm.  So if you need an updated sticker for campus access, the opportunity for that before our scheduled exam is limited.
In any case, allow extra time on Monday before the exam in the case of difficulty or delay.

<li> I have asked for permission to have the in-person exam on Monday, May 13th and am waiting for confirmation.

<li>  <a href="whatDoINeedOnThe213Final.html">This grade estimator</a> gives an estimation of needed grades on remaining exams and the final for particular grades, using the calculation specified on the Course Information Sheet above.

<li> There are old departmental finals to help with preparing for the final.  Since 213 has not been around that long and has changed (deleted surface integrals, Stokes' Theorem, and Divergence Theorem topics) there are the following useful resources:

<ul>
<li>  <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213</a> has some sample final exams
<li> <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-20300/">Math 203</a> has some sample final exams and some with solutions.  For these, you can ignore the series topics and concentrate on the differential multivariate questions (partials, chain rule, max/min, gradient, directional derivative, tangent planes, etc.) and the integral multivariate questions (double and triple integrals, coordinate systems, applications to centers of mass and moments, etc.)
<li> <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-39200/">Math 392</a> has some sample final exams and some solutions.  For these, you can ignore the linear algebra and matrix topics and concentrate on the line integral questions.  We no longer cover parametric surfaces, surface area, surface integrals, Stokes' Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem, so you can ignore those.
</ul>

<li> Some Pearson deadlines extended again.
<li> Lecture will be online via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra on Wednesday, May 8th.  I hope to be able to have in-person Exam 3 on Monday, May 13th or Wednesday, May 15th but the return-to-campus plan is not clear.
<li> There are many old departmental final exams with conservative vector field problems on the <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-39200/">Math 392</a> webpage.
<li> One difference between one variable relative min/max problems and several variable max/min problems is that for one variable, if there are two relative maxima, there needs to be a relative minimum in between them.  But for several variables, things can be much more complicated.  See <a href="../humps.html">this page</a> for an example of two maxima without a saddle or minimum also present.
<li> Office hours May 6th online via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.
<li> Class via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra on May 6th.
<li> To get the most from the lectures, read the relevant sections of Chapter 16 before and after lecture.
<li> Some assignment deadlines extended.
<li>For the expected Exam 3 on May 13th, there will be two options:
<ul>
<li>Get the whole exam at the beginning of class, and complete it in one sitting.</li>
<li>Get the first half of the exam at the beginning of class. After 50 minutes, turn that part in and then take a break of up to 5 minutes. Then get the second half of the exam and complete the second half in the remaining time.</li>
</ul>
If you expect to need to leave briefly during the exam, you should opt for the two-part option. No student who arrives later than 15 minutes after the exam begins may choose the two-part option. No one-part exam student may leave until one hour has elapsed. If you are interested in the two-part exam option, let me know by email by the Wednesday before so that I can duplicate exams appropriately.</li>

<li> There is no official word about when to return to campus, but I am hopeful that it will be by  Wednesday, May 8th, which would work with Exam 3 being on Monday, May 13th.

<li> We are waiting for guidance about returning to campus.  For Exam 3, it would not be appropriate to have it without a week of advance notice, so I am hopeful that we can have our in-person exam on May 13th.  Expect topics to be those up to the homework due on the day of the exam, with an emphasis on the more recent topics of triple integrals, line integrals including work and flux, conservative vector fields, theorems and definitions, and possibly up to Green's Theorem depending upon the return-to-campus schedule.
<li> Notes from May 1st lecture posted to Blackboard under "Content."
<li> Office hours on Blackboard Collaborate Ultra classroom.
<li> Front row duty on hold until we return to in-person class meetings.
<li>Class via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra on May 1st in two sessions, 8:00 to 8:45 and then 8:45 to 9:40</li>
<li>From Blackboard, go to "Collaborate" then "Class Collaborate Ultra" then the appropriate session.</li>
<li> Office hours May 1st online via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.
<li> Class via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra on May 1st.
<li> Some assignment deadlines extended.
<li> Regrade requests open for Exam 2 until Friday, May 3rd, 8am.
<li> The official final exam schedule for Mathematics Department group final exams at <a href="">this location</a> and our final exam is Monday, May 20th, from 1:00PM â€“ 3:15PM.  The room assignments for final exams have not been made and I will post here once we have a room assignment.

<li> No class meetings on April 22-30, have a good Spring Recess.

<li> Exam 2  graded, scores on Gradescope, exams returned via Gradescope, from which you should have received email.
<li> Exam 3 to be on Wednesday, May 8th instead of the Monday, as tentatively scheduled.
<li> It is not official yet, but I have been asking and now told to expect that our final exam will be Monday, May 20th, at 1pm.

<li> The CCNY Physics Club is hosting an Integration Bee April 16 and 18, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1wsKEnUwe7HL77Ol_qCSa0Ygc1G-xztuLIQu4D6oegLWuQg/viewform">this page</a> for more information and to sign up.

<li>Exam 2 coming up, Monday April 15th at 8am.</li>
<li>Topics for Exam 2 are those up to and including those covered by the assignment due on the day of the exam (16.1). The likely emphasis is on the material since the first exam, but we are using the material from earlier chapters routinely.</li>
<li>Make sure to know the definitions, the theorems, the concepts, the techniques, and be able to do the computations and calculations correctly and efficiently.</li>
<li>To help prepare for Exam 2, there are bonus office hours:
<ul>
<li>Send email if you would like to meet at either 7:15am in my Marshak office or at 7:30am in our classroom on Wednesday 4/10.</li>
<li>Wednesday, 4/10, 1:30pm to 2:30pm</li>
<li>Thursday, 4/11, 10:30am-11:30am.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For Exam 2, there are be two options:
<ul>
<li>Get the whole exam at the beginning of class, and complete it in one sitting.</li>
<li>Get the first half of the exam at the beginning of class. After 50 minutes, turn that part in and then take a break of up to 5 minutes. Then get the second half of the exam and complete the second half in the remaining time.</li>
</ul>

<li> Monday Apr 8th: no in-person lecture, lectures online asynchronously via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.  No office hours on Monday, Apr 8th.

<li> Two integration problems from lecture in Mathematica as a <a href="TripleIntegralExamples.pdf">PDF</a> and as a <a href="TripleIntegralExamples.nb">Mathematica Notebook</a>.  To open the notebook, you will need Mathematica which is available for free for CUNY students, see below.
<li> Exam 2 coming up, Monday April 15th at 8am.
<li> Some Pearson deadlines extended.
<li> For Exam 2, there will be two options:
<ul>
<li> Get the whole exam at the beginning of class, and complete it in one sitting.

If you are interested in the two-part exam option, let me know by email by the Wednesday before so that I can duplicate exams appropriately.
<li> <a href="ParaboloidAndPlane.png">Here</a> is a much better image drawn via <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> (available free to CCNY students, see <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/available_software">this page</a>) of what we were describing in class as the region between the elliptic paraboloid z=x^2+y^2 and the plane z=y+2 

<lI> For moments of inertia about different axes, there is a nice page at Wikipedia about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_racket_theorem">Tennis Racket Theorem/Intermediate Axis Theorem</a> which includes a video of the Dzhanibekov phenomenon in microgravity for the intermediate inertia axis stability.


<li> For students not as comfortable participating in class, there are participation possibilities in the Blackboard discussion boards.  For example, since the Pearson questions are generally calculations rather than being more conceptual, there are many exercises in the Thomas' eText which would be appropriate to present in the discussion areas.

<li> A handout <a href="symplane.pdf">available here</a> on symmetry and multiple integrals may be helpful for understanding how to use symmetry for a range of problems.

<li> Bonus office hours: Monday 3/18 2:15-2:45pm, and I can meet Wednesday 3/20 before class.  Send email if you would like to meet at either 7:15am in my Marshak office or at 7:30am in our classroom on Wednesday 3/20.

<li> Exam 1 graded, scores on Gradescope, exams returned via Gradescope, from which you should have received email.  I posted some general comments on the Blackboard discussion area about the exam.

<li> Min/max homework assignment deadline extended to 3/18.
<li> Second exam date now Monday, April 15th.
<li> Exam 1 on Wednesday, 3/6.  Make sure to allow plenty of travel time to arrive ready to answer Calc III questions.  Bring a photo ID and know your EMPLID.
<li> Pearson outage for about an hour over the weekend, so to help accommodate students who had difficulty, the deadline for HW on 14.4 on the chain rule is postponed one day.
<li> Exam 1 coming up, Wed March 6th, will cover material up to and including all sections that have had assignments due that day or earlier.
<li> Wednesday, Feb 28th: CCNY Monday schedule, so we meet as usual.

<li> There are many old departmental 203 finals at <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-20300/">this page</a> which serve as good sample exam questions.  Just about every topic that we have covered that has many samples from those old exams.
<li>  Thursday, Feb 22: I have my usual (Monday) office hours since we behave at CCNY as if it were Monday.
<li> Thursday, Feb 22: our class meets as if it is Monday.  Topics will be those from 14.2, 14.3, and 14.4, which overlap with Lessons 12 to 15 from the Calc III with Dr. Marchese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaurYp0Zl_s_VU8gcp3wdmFT4hFxsrHN">playlist</a> on YouTube.
<li> Quiz 1 graded, scores on Gradescope.

<li> There will be a short 10min quiz at the start of lecture Wed, Feb 14th.  Make sure to know your EMPLID.  If you cannot arrive by the start of the quiz at 8am, please wait outside the classroom until quizzes are collected at 8:10am to avoid disturbing students taking the quiz.

<li>There is a Blackboard quiz now available on quadric surfaces, and I extended the deadlines for the preceding two Blackboard quizzes to Wednesday 2/14 before class to accommodate students who had difficulty with enrollment.Â 

<li>  The upcoming lecture schedule is a bit of a jumble:
<ul>
<li> Mon, Feb 12: CCNY classes do not meet, we do not meet.
<li> Wed Feb 14: our class meets as usual
<li> Mon, Feb 19: CCNY classes do not meet, we do not meet.
<li> Wed Feb 21 our class meets as usual
<li> Thurs Feb 22: CCNY Monday classes meet, so our class meets on Thursday.
<li> Mon, Feb 26:  our class meets as usual
<li> Wed, Feb 28: CCNY Monday classes meet, so our class meets as usual
</ul>

<li> For questions, a good place to ask is in the Blackboard discussion area.

<li> I extended the deadlines for the first two assignments on Pearson to Wednesday 2/7 to help accommodate students who did not get the Pearson system in a timely manner.Â  As mentioned in the earlier announcements, even for those who do not have a subscription for the system, there is a two-week trial period.Â  If you are using the trial period, make sure to secure access before your trial period ends.

<li> Homework deadlines on 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, and 13.1 postponed as we have not covered that far enough in advance.

<li> First lecture is Monday, January 29th in NAC 1/203, which is toward the left (southeast) after entering the main entrance near the flagpoles on the NAC Plaza from Convent Ave.

<li> Instructions for enrolling in the Pearson MyLab system are on Blackboard as an annoucement and emailed to students at the email address associated to your Blackboard account.  If you are enrolled as of Jan 25th but have not gotten such email, please check your Blackboard settings.


<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Blackboard discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.

<li> Introductory quizes "Quiz0" and "Quiz 1" are available on Blackboard and should be completed by Feb 8th.


<li> We will be using the Pearson MyLab system for the text and online homework assignments.  I will send instructions but if you already have purchased an electronic or loose-leaf version of the Thomas'
Calculus 14th edition Early Transcendentals text, for example for CCNY Math 201 or 212, you shouldn't need to purchase anything new.  If not, CCNY has arranged for electronic or loose-leaf text purchase both of which include electronic access to MyLab for the homework system.  There will be instructions sent to enrolled students for those which are about $80 for the electronic version, or about $115 for the looseleaf paper copy,  both including required MyLab homework system access.

<li> The video lessons from the old Math 203 course which overlaps 213 considerably are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">here</a>. To review prerequisite material, you may want to consider Lesson 7 "Cylinders" and Lesson 8 "Quadric Surfaces" which were covered in Math 212.


<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213 page</a> which may be helpful.

<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201, 202, and 203.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a review or supplement.
<li> For those who took a course comparable to Math 212 elsewhere or a while ago, there
is a range of information available about current CCNY Math 212 <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">here</a> including syllabi, assignments, and sample departmental final exams.
<li> Sample departmental finals from Math 213 are available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalA">here</a> and <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalB">here.</a>
