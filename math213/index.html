<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Blackboard discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.

<li> An introductory quiz "Quiz0" is available on Blackboard and should be completed by Sept. 7th.

<li> First lecture is Monday, Aug 29th.

<!--- ><li> Instructions for enrolling in the Pearson Mylab course system have been emailed to enrolled students.  If you have already recently purchased the correct version of the text for CCNY Math 201, 212 or elsewhere, you should not need to purchase it again and should be able to complete your Mylab enrollment already.
---!>
<li>A "Welcome" message has been emailed to all enrolled students.  If you did not get such an email, make sure that your Blackboard and CUNY First email addresses are set to places that you check.

<li> We will be using the Pearson MyLab system for the text and online homework assignments.  I will send instructions but if you already have purchased an electronic or loose-leaf version of the Thomas'
Calculus 14th edition Early Transcendentals text, for example for CCNY Math 201 or 212, you shouldn't need to purchase anything new.  If not, CCNY has arranged for electronic or loose-leaf text purchase both of which include electronic access to MyLab for the homework system.  There will be instructions sent to enrolled students for those which are about $80 for the electronic version, or about $115 for the looseleaf paper copy,  both including required MyLab homework system access.
<li> The video lessons from the old Math 203 course are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">here</a>.  A good place to start is Lesson 9 which corresponds to about where we are starting.
<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">Math 212 page</a> including some review material which may be helpful.

<li> The prerequisite topics are those in Math 212 as taught at CCNY since Fall 2019- see <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/Math_212_syllabus_CLO.pdf">this description of 212 topics</a>. 
If you are missing some of those topics from taking a course which is judged equivalent
(generally having about 80% of the topics) it is a good idea to fill those gaps before the term starts as it will be difficult to pass the class without mastery of
topics from 213 including <ul>
<li> Vector operations including dot and cross product, with both algebraic and geometric understanding
<li> Lines, planes, and parameterized curves, in the plane and in space.
<li> Functions of several variables: limits, properties, and partial derivatives.
<li> Classifying and sketching of surfaces in space, including cylinders and quadric surfaces</ul>
<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201, 202, and 203.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a review or supplement.
<li> A sample final from Math 212 is available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/Math+212+Sample+In-Class+Final+Exam">here</a> as a reminder of prerequisite material needed for 213.
<li> A sample final from Math 213 is available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalA">here.</a>
