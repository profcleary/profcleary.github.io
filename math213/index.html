<li>  Nov 6: last day to withdraw.
<li>  Friday, Oct 24: Monday classes meet, does not affect our course
<li> The Mathematics department is enforcing CCNY rules for e-permitting. In particular:
<ul>
<li>
Students must have need to take a class on permit.
<li>
Before e-permitting a class, students must meet with a math advisor, who will discuss with you issues that can arise from e-permitting.
<li>
On any e-permit request, the department requires you to indicate the reason you need to go on e-permit and the name of a math advisor who you have spoken to and supports your e-permit choice.
</ul>
For details on this policy, see the <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/undergraduate/#epermit">undergraduate program page</a> on the department website.
<li> Section 15.2 on double integrals over non-rectangular regions assignment postponed. 
<li> The integral of secant cubed that came up in class today is done on p.497 in Section 7.2 of our text.

<li>If you had a hard time with course material, you may want to come to 
tutoring in the <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-tutoring/">Artino Lab</a> (NAC1511), the Marshak Math/Physics Tutoring Center (Marshak 106), post questions in our Brightspace discussions, or come to office hours.

 
<li> Some WeBWorK assignment deadlines postponed as we have not covered the material in lecture yet.

<li> For Exam 2 on Thurs Oct 23rd, there will be two options:
<ul>
<li> Get the whole exam at the beginning of class, and complete it in one sitting.
<li> Get the first half of the exam at the beginning of class. After 50 minutes, turn that part in and then take a break of up to 5 minutes. Then get the second half of the exam and complete the second half in the remaining time.
</ul>
If you expect to need to leave briefly during the exam, you should opt for the two-part option. No student who arrives later than 15 minutes after the exam begins may choose the two-part option. No one-part exam student may leave until one hour has elapsed.

If you are interested in the two-part exam option, let me know by email by at least
one week before the exam so that I can duplicate exams appropriately.
<li> There are some old exam questions available on Brightspace under "Content/Resources" to help prepare, covering the material over the course of the term.
<li> Exam 2 topics will come from lecture, the text, and homework and will include everything up to what is due on the day of the exam.
 Bring photo ID and expect to leave your belongings at the front of the classroom..

<li> Introductory quiz "Quiz1" is available on Brightspace and is due Sept 9th.


<li> We will be using the WeBWorK assignment system for homework which is at
<a href="https://webwork.ccny.cuny.edu/webwork2/25_Fa213_KL""> https://webwork.ccny.cuny.edu/webwork2/25_Fa213_KL </a> part of the <a href="https://webwork.ccny.cuny.edu/webwork2">CCNY WeBWorK</a> system

To log in there, use your CCNY account information (what you would use to connect to the wireless network or the CCNY email student email system) without the @citymail.cuny.edu, same password.  There are already a few assignments posted there so you check make sure that you can log in and begin to familiarize yourself with the system.  If you are not able to connect to the system, you may need to visit the CCNY Helpdesk and reset your password there.

Note: to login to the WeBWorK system, use just the username part of your login, and not the @citymail.cuny.edu part.


<li> Students enrolled in the course as of August  should have received a 213 welcome email.  Please check your registration and email settings if you believe you are enrolled in the course but have not gotten such an email.

<li> First lecture is Tuesday, Aug 26th, in NAC 1/203, which is toward the left (southeast) after entering the main entrance near the flagpoles on the NAC Plaza from Convent Ave.


<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Brightspace discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.

<li> Introductory quizes "Quiz0" "Quiz 1" are available on Brightspace and should be completed by Sept 9th.


<li> Our class will meet in NAC 1/203 in the North Academic Center, on the first floor.  You can head left from the plaza entry near the flagpoles.  

<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Brightspace discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.


<li> Review quiz on quadric surfaces is  available on Brightspace and is due Sept 9th.  Note that you will also need to submit photos or images of handwritten
work (in this case, sketches) as supporting material on Brightspace, under "Assignments/Supporting Work for Quadric Surface quiz"

<li> Introductory quiz "Quiz0" is  available on Brightspace and is due Sept 9th.



<li> We will be using the WeBWorK system for electronic homework, but it is important to get in the habit of working out exercises clearly and completely by hand.  Furthermore, note that the electronic system does not test many important aspects of the course, including knowing the definitions, theorems, and proofs, as well as geometric aspects such as sketching both in the plane and in space.  

<li> The video lessons from the old Math 203 course which overlaps 213 considerably are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">here</a>. To review prerequisite material, you may want to consider Lesson 7 "Cylinders" and Lesson 8 "Quadric Surfaces" which were covered in Math 212.


<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213 page</a> which may be helpful.

<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201, 202, and 203.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a review or supplement.
<li> For those who took a course comparable to Math 212 elsewhere or a while ago, there
is a range of information available about current CCNY Math 212 <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">here</a> including syllabi, assignments, and sample departmental final exams.
<li> Sample departmental finals from Math 213 are available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">here</a>.
