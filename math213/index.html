<!---<li> The process for CCNY students to get Mathematica is described <a href="https://support.ccny.cuny.edu/software/BETA_CityCollege_UNL_Website.html">here</a>.  The CUNY site license allows free student use of the full version.!--->

<li> These are about the last topics this term that we will cover which have lessons from the
 <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">Math 203 Video Lessons</a>:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://youtu.be/MZ0BfwFN62s">Lesson 21 Double Integrals Over Rectangles</a>
<li> <a href="http://youtu.be/TzqDhd5tkvQ">Lesson 22 Double Integrals General Regions</a>

<li> <a href="http://youtu.be/VusSoBgR44g">Lesson 23 Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates</a>
<li> <a href="http://youtu.be/Q_f6GCViDQM">Lesson 24 Applications of the Double Integral</a>
<li> <a href="http://youtu.be/hXrbq7jOA0Q">Lesson 26 Triple Integrals
</a>
<li> <a href="http://youtu.be/wmnnTRH6nlk">Lesson 27 Cylindrical Coordinates</a>
<li> <a href="http://youtu.be/E1NoXTT1OOE">Lesson 28 Spherical Coordinates</a>


</ul>



<li> HW 15.3, 15.4 deadlines extended.
<li> 15.2 HW deadline extended.
<li> Handout on symmetry with multiple integrals is <a href="symplane.pdf">here.</a>  It describes the approach for triple integrals but the ideas are similar for planar regions.
<li> There is a large optional homework assignment on Pearson which does not count for scores but can be used for students interested in reviewing previous material.
<li> No class on Wed, Oct 5th.
<li> Exam 1 graded, scores on Blackboard and available on Gradescope.  You should have received an email from Gradescope with information about how to connect.
<li> Class meets on Thursday, Sept 29 as it is a Monday schedule for CCNY.
<li> Some HW deadlines extended a bit to next week.

<li> For exam 1 on Wednesday, Sept 21st, bring a photo ID and know your EMPLID.

<li> CUNY schedule affects our class meetings.  No class Monday, Sept 26.  Bonus class on Thursday=Monday on Sept 29th.  No class Oct 5th or Oct 10th.
<li> Exam 1 coming up: Wednesday, Sept 21st.  Covers all material upto homework due that day.

<li> Pearson MyLab 14.4 due date moved to <s>Friday, Sep 9th</s> Monday, Sept 12th, at 9am.

<li> Room change for section EF, the 2pm-3:40pm class: we will now meet in NAC 6/114.

<li> I created six optional assignments on the Pearson system.  The scores do not count and you can take them as many times as you like.  They may be useful for reviewing 212 material, both for those who took second semester calculus elsewhere (and without an introduction to multivariate topics) and for those who did not master that in CCNY 212.  The topics covered are: polar coordinates, quadrics and cylinders, vectors and vector operations, lines and planes in space, multivariate functions, and partial derivatives.

<li> The CCNY Fall 22 <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/registrar/fall-2022-final-exam-schedule">final exam schedule</a> is now available, but unfortunately it does not yet have the 213 Group Final scheduled.  Note that math department group final exams are not based on course meeting times, unlike all other courses at CCNY.

<li> Instructions for enrolling in the Pearson Mylab course system have been emailed to enrolled students.  If you have already recently purchased the correct version of the text for CCNY Math 201, 212 or elsewhere, you should not need to purchase it again and should be able to complete your Mylab enrollment already.   There are many versions of the text and  we are using Thomas' Calculus, Early Transcendentals, 14th edition.

<li> Some sections in our text covering 212 material that may be good to refresh are listed below. These were covered in 212 but may not have been covered in courses at other institutions.

<ul> 

<li> 11.1: Polar Coordinates
<li> 12.3, 12.4: Dot and cross products
<li> 12.5: Lines and planes in space
<li> 12.6: Quadric surfaces and cylinders
<li> 14.1: Functions of several variables
<li> 14.2: Limits of functions of several variables
<li> 14.3: Partial Derivatives

</ul>

<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Blackboard discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.

<li> Introductory quizes "Quiz0" and "Quiz 1" are available on Blackboard and should be completed by Sept. 7th.

<li> First lecture is Monday, Aug 29th.


<li>A "Welcome" message has been emailed to students enrolled as of August 22nd.  If you did not get such an email, make sure that your Blackboard and CUNY First email addresses are set to places that you check, and that your enrollment is correct.

<li> We will be using the Pearson MyLab system for the text and online homework assignments.  I will send instructions but if you already have purchased an electronic or loose-leaf version of the Thomas'
Calculus 14th edition Early Transcendentals text, for example for CCNY Math 201 or 212, you shouldn't need to purchase anything new.  If not, CCNY has arranged for electronic or loose-leaf text purchase both of which include electronic access to MyLab for the homework system.  There will be instructions sent to enrolled students for those which are about $80 for the electronic version, or about $115 for the looseleaf paper copy,  both including required MyLab homework system access.
<li> The video lessons from the old Math 203 course are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">here</a>.  A good place to start is Lesson 9 which corresponds to about where we are starting, or you may want to review prerequisite material. 
<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213 page</a> including some review material which may be helpful.

<li> The prerequisite topics for Math 213 are those in Math 212 as taught at CCNY since Fall 2019- see <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/Math_212_syllabus_CLO.pdf">this description of 212 topics</a>. 
If you are missing some of those topics from taking a course which is judged equivalent
(generally having about 80% of the topics) it is a good idea to fill those gaps before the term starts as it will be difficult to pass the class without mastery of
topics from 212 including <ul>
<li> Vector operations including dot and cross product, with both algebraic and geometric understanding
<li> Lines, planes, and parameterized curves, in the plane and in space.
<li> Functions of several variables: limits, properties, and partial derivatives.
<li> Classifying and sketching of surfaces in space, including cylinders and quadric surfaces</ul>
<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201, 202, and 203.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a review or supplement.
<li> A sample final from Math 212 is available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/Math+212+Sample+In-Class+Final+Exam">here</a> as a reminder of prerequisite material needed for 213.
<li> A sample final from Math 213 is available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalA">here.</a>
