<strong>Announcements: </strong>

<li> As mentioned in class, for most students, the Pearson homework system is not the best way to learn the material and prepare for the exams.  For most students, reading the text before the lecture, reading the text after the lecture, attempting old departmental final exams, and reviewing notes is more effective.  The course
has both conceptual and computational aspects and the HW emphasizes the computational aspects (grouped neatly into sections) at the expense of the concepts.  Reviewing old final exams from 203 is generally good preparation for exams as an important skill is classifying which approach to take for problems.

<li> Some HW deadlines have been moved to accommodate students who think the HW is a good way to prepare for the upcoming exam.

<li> I moved the deadlines for some HWs due Wed 10/4 noon to Fri 10/6 at noon.
<li> Exam 2 coming up, Wednesday Oct 18th.
<li> A good place to ask questions about Exam 1 is on the Blackboard discussion board.

<li> Exam 1 graded, scores on Blackboard, exams returned via Gradescope, from which you should have received email.  I posted some general comments on the Blackboard discussion area.
<li> Class does not meet on Monday, Oct 9, but does meet on Tuesday, Oct 10th as that is a Tues=Mon day for CCNY.

<li> Lecture on Wednesday 9/20 will be online, via Blackboard Course Collaborate Ultra sessions.

<li> For students wanting to look at homework problems after the due date, there are many problems listed in the eText at the end of each section, and there are also options which can help under the "Study Plan" on the Pearson system.

<li> Exam 1 coming up, Monday 9/18, covering up to the topics covered in lecture, the text, up until those for the homework due on Monday 9/18 (13.1).

<li> I moved the deadline for HW 13.3 to Oct 4th, since we haven't covered arc length integrals yet.

<li> There is an AWM/Math Club Welcome event Thursday, September 7, 12:30-2pm to the Math Club Room (MR 308A), with pizza and games.  More details about upcoming events are at <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/awm/">the CCNY AWM/Math Club page</a>.

<li> I moved deadlines for some of the first Pearson online homework assignments to Friday 9/8 at noon to accommodate students who are justing getting started with the system.
<li> Class meets in 6/114 for the duration of the term.

<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Blackboard discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.

<li> Introductory quizes "Quiz0" and "Quiz 1" are available on Blackboard and should be completed by Sept. 7th.

<li>A "Welcome" message has been emailed to students enrolled as of August 22nd.  If you did not get such an email, make sure that your Blackboard and CUNY First email addresses are set to places that you check, and that your enrollment is correct.



<li> First lecture is Monday, Aug 28th.


<li> We will be using the Pearson MyLab system for the text and online homework assignments.  I will send instructions but if you already have purchased an electronic or loose-leaf version of the Thomas'
Calculus 14th edition Early Transcendentals text, for example for CCNY Math 201 or 212, you shouldn't need to purchase anything new.  If not, CCNY has arranged for electronic or loose-leaf text purchase both of which include electronic access to MyLab for the homework system.  There will be instructions sent to enrolled students for those which are about $80 for the electronic version, or about $115 for the looseleaf paper copy,  both including required MyLab homework system access.

<li> The video lessons from the old Math 203 course are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">here</a>. To review prerequisite material, you may want to consider Lesson 7 "Cylinders" and Lesson 8 "Quadric Surfaces" which were covered in Math 212.


<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213 page</a> which may be helpful.

<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201, 202, and 203.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a review or supplement.
<li> For those who took a course comparable to Math 212 elsewhere or a while ago, there
is a range of information available about current CCNY Math 212 <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">here</a> including syllabi, assignments, and sample departmental final exams.
<li> Sample departmental finals from Math 213 are available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalA">here</a> and <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalB">here.</a>
