<strong>Announcements: </strong>
<ul>

<li> One of the other 213 instructors, Ms. Begum, posted a video with solutions to the Sample Final A at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cnqa3S6He0">this YouTube link</a> to be shared.
<li> Bonus office hours to prepare for the final: Monday, 12/11 10am, Tuesday 12/12 11am, Wed 12/13 11am.
<li> Seat assignments for the final exam are <a href="seats.html">here</a> for Marshak MR3.  The front row is row A and the numbers go from 1 on the south end (right as facing the boards)Â to 21 on the north end.
<li> There is an additional final on the  <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213 page</a>now, from Spring 2023.
<li> Seat assignments for the final exam will be posted here before classes end.
<li> There are old departmental finals to help with preparing for the final.  Since 213 has not been around that long and has changed (deleted surface integrals, Stokes' Theorem, and Divergence Theorem topics) there are the following useful resources:

<ul>
<li>  <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213</a> has some sample final exams
<li> <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-20300/">Math 203</a> has some sample final exams and some with solutions.  For these, you can ignore the series topics and concentrate on the differential multivariate questions (partials, chain rule, max/min, gradient, directional derivative, tangent planes, etc.) and the integral multivariate questions (double and triple integrals, coordinate systems, applications to centers of mass and moments, etc.)
<li> <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-39200/">Math 392</a> has some sample final exams and some solutions.  For these, you can ignore the linear algebra and matrix topics and concentrate on the line integral questions.  We no longer cover parametric surfaces, surface area, surface integrals, Stokes' Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem, so you can ignore those.
</ul>

<li> Our final exam will be Monday, December 18 at 1:00PM - 3:15PM in room Marshak MR3.
<li> There is an end-of-term quiz available on Blackboard.  Note that you can take the quiz an unlimited number of times and only the last score counts.
<li> Deadlines for last two Pearson assignments postponed to the last day of our class as we are still covering that material.
<li> There is a nice page a Wikipedia about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_racket_theorem">Tennis Racket Theorem/Intermediate Axis Theorem</a> which includes a video of the Dzhanibekov phenomenon in microgravity for the intermediate inertia axis stability.
<li> The <a href="https://k16.cuny.edu/tutorcorps/">CUNY Tutor Corps</a> is looking for
algebra tutors to get $20/hour to tutor students in a New York City Public High School in person this Spring for 12-15 hours per week for $20 per hour.  See this <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenxTengB9n84LQRwbffP64cM2tlh_vV0aeL6Y5qMidzvfhuA/viewform?usp=sf_link__;!!PxiZbSOawA!N8Nb9HHf6n3HRkFWccihJOuKh22SNHutc4dw4G756Io0LVFHzg4ojnTEM5kj2ofM_5i2898YM_trclkOeYdQeXeT1g$">form</a> to apply.
<li> Third exam graded, scores on Gradescope.  Some comments about the questions are on the Blackboard discussion area.
<li> HW on conservative vectorfields deadline postponed since we haven't completed the section yet.
<li> Parameterization quiz graded, scores on Gradescope.
<li> Expect a Blackboard quiz or two over the next couple of weeks.  I anticipate there being five total quizzes (two early BB ones, one in person one so far), and the highest three scores (as percentages) will count to accommodate students who missed a quiz.

<li> The official schedule for all finals is now available <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/registrar/fall-2023-final-exam-schedule">here</a>.  Our final will be the departmental one on Monday, December 18 at 1:00PM - 3:15PM.  Room TBA but will certainly not be our regular classroom- more likely a large lecture hall, perhaps in Marshak.
<li> Happy Thanksgiving!  The second part of the HW on 16.2 is postponed to be due Wednesday, Nov 29th.
<li> Departmental 213 final exam scheduled for Monday, Dec 18, 1:00pm-3:15pm.   More details as this becomes officially confirmed.
<li> Exam 3, Monday Nov 20.  Class does not meet Wednesday, Nov 22nd, have a good Thanksgiving!
<li> Possible short quiz at the start of lecture Wed, Nov 15th.
<li> Exam 3 coming up, Monday Nov 20th.
<li> There is a  <a href="pumpkin.pdf">Great Pumpkin</a> example about work integrals on the sphere.

<li> I divided the homework assignment for 16.2 into two pieces, as we have a great deal of material yet to cover and there is the upcoming Exam 3 on Monday, Nov 20th and then the Thanksgiving holiday.
<li> We are beginning Chapter 16 on vector fields on Monday, Nov 6th.  I moved the homework on spherical triple integrals due date to Wednesday.

<li>  <a href="whatDoINeedOnThe213Final.html">This grade calculator</a> gives an estimation of needed grades on remaining exams and the final for particular grades, using the calculation specified on the Course Information Sheet above.
<li> Wed Nov 1st office hours postponed to 4pm to accomodate a meeting.
<li> I moved the deadlines for some HWs later as we are going more slowly than needed and have not covered the relevant topics yet.

<li> Some comments about common issues on Exam 2 posted to a Blackboard discussion thread.

<li> Exam 2 graded and available on Gradescope, with scores on Blackboard.

<li> A handout <a href="symplane.pdf">available here</a> on symmetry and multiple integrals may be helpful for understanding how to use symmetry for a range of problems.


<li> As mentioned in class, for most students, the Pearson homework system is not the best way to learn the material and prepare for the exams.  For most students, reading the text before the lecture, reading the text after the lecture, attempting old departmental final exams, and reviewing notes is more effective.  The course
has both conceptual and computational aspects and the HW emphasizes the computational aspects (grouped neatly into sections) at the expense of the concepts.  Reviewing old final exams from 203 is generally good preparation for exams as an important skill is classifying which approach to take for problems.

<li> Some HW deadlines have been moved to accommodate students who think the HW is a good way to prepare for the upcoming exam.

<li> I moved the deadlines for some HWs due Wed 10/4 noon to Fri 10/6 at noon.
<li> Exam 2 coming up, Wednesday Oct 18th.
<li> A good place to ask questions about Exam 1 is on the Blackboard discussion board.

<li> Exam 1 graded, scores on Blackboard, exams returned via Gradescope, from which you should have received email.  I posted some general comments on the Blackboard discussion area.
<li> Class does not meet on Monday, Oct 9, but does meet on Tuesday, Oct 10th as that is a Tues=Mon day for CCNY.

<li> Lecture on Wednesday 9/20 will be online, via Blackboard Course Collaborate Ultra sessions.

<li> For students wanting to look at homework problems after the due date, there are many problems listed in the eText at the end of each section, and there are also options which can help under the "Study Plan" on the Pearson system.

<li> Exam 1 coming up, Monday 9/18, covering up to the topics covered in lecture, the text, up until those for the homework due on Monday 9/18 (13.1).

<li> I moved the deadline for HW 13.3 to Oct 4th, since we haven't covered arc length integrals yet.

<li> There is an AWM/Math Club Welcome event Thursday, September 7, 12:30-2pm to the Math Club Room (MR 308A), with pizza and games.  More details about upcoming events are at <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/awm/">the CCNY AWM/Math Club page</a>.

<li> I moved deadlines for some of the first Pearson online homework assignments to Friday 9/8 at noon to accommodate students who are justing getting started with the system.
<li> Class meets in 6/114 for the duration of the term.

<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Blackboard discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.

<li> Introductory quizes "Quiz0" and "Quiz 1" are available on Blackboard and should be completed by Sept. 7th.

<li>A "Welcome" message has been emailed to students enrolled as of August 22nd.  If you did not get such an email, make sure that your Blackboard and CUNY First email addresses are set to places that you check, and that your enrollment is correct.



<li> First lecture is Monday, Aug 28th.


<li> We will be using the Pearson MyLab system for the text and online homework assignments.  I will send instructions but if you already have purchased an electronic or loose-leaf version of the Thomas'
Calculus 14th edition Early Transcendentals text, for example for CCNY Math 201 or 212, you shouldn't need to purchase anything new.  If not, CCNY has arranged for electronic or loose-leaf text purchase both of which include electronic access to MyLab for the homework system.  There will be instructions sent to enrolled students for those which are about $80 for the electronic version, or about $115 for the looseleaf paper copy,  both including required MyLab homework system access.

<li> The video lessons from the old Math 203 course are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">here</a>. To review prerequisite material, you may want to consider Lesson 7 "Cylinders" and Lesson 8 "Quadric Surfaces" which were covered in Math 212.


<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213 page</a> which may be helpful.

<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201, 202, and 203.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a review or supplement.
<li> For those who took a course comparable to Math 212 elsewhere or a while ago, there
is a range of information available about current CCNY Math 212 <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">here</a> including syllabi, assignments, and sample departmental final exams.
<li> Sample departmental finals from Math 213 are available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalA">here</a> and <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalB">here.</a>
