<li> First lecture is Monday, January 29th in NAC 1/203, which is toward the left (southeast) after entering the main entrance near the flagpoles on the NAC Plaza from Convent Ave.

<!--- <li> Instructions for enrolling in the Pearson MyLab system are on Blackboard as an annoucement and emailed to students at the email address associated to your Blackboard account.  If you are enrolled as of Jan 25th but have not gotten such email, please check your Blackboard settings. !--->


<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Brightspace discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.

<li> Introductory quizes "Quiz0" and "Quiz 1" are available on Brightspace and should be completed by Feb 8th.



<li> We will be using the WeBWorK system for electronic homework, but it is important to get in the habit of working out exercises clearly and completely by hand.  Furthermore, note that the electronic system does not test many important aspects of the course, including knowing the definitions, theorems, and proofs, as well as geometric aspects such as sketching both in the plane and in space.  

<li> The video lessons from the old Math 203 course which overlaps 213 considerably are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">here</a>. To review prerequisite material, you may want to consider Lesson 7 "Cylinders" and Lesson 8 "Quadric Surfaces" which were covered in Math 212.


<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21300/">Math 213 page</a> which may be helpful.

<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201, 202, and 203.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a review or supplement.
<li> For those who took a course comparable to Math 212 elsewhere or a while ago, there
is a range of information available about current CCNY Math 212 <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">here</a> including syllabi, assignments, and sample departmental final exams.
<li> Sample departmental finals from Math 213 are available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalA">here</a> and <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/MATH213SampleFinalB">here.</a>
