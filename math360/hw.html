<strong> Dr. Cleary's Math 360 S19 Homework Assignments: </strong> <br>
 <br>
<ul>

 <li>HW1, due Thurs, Feb 4th
    <ol>
    Consider the following axiom set.
<ul>
<li> Axiom 1.  Every team plays at least two games.
<li> Axiom 2.  Every game has at least two teams.
<li> Axiom 3.  There exists at least one team.
</ul>

<li> What are the undefined terms in this axiom set?
<li> Prove Theorem 1. There exists at least one game.
<li> What is the minimum number of games? Prove.
<li> Find two models that show that the statement "There are exactly two teams" is independent of the axioms.
<li> Find two models that show that the statement "Every team plays every other team" is independent of the axioms.
</ol>




 <li>HW2, due Thursday, Feb 11th
    <ul>
      <li> Stahl, 1.2 #2: make precise statements of Euclid's propositions 5 to 9 using modern terminology and notation
      
      <li> Stahl, 1.2, #10: prove that the angle bisectors of a triangle are concurrent (meet in a single point.)  Does this hold in neutral geometry as well?
   
    </ul>
    
     <p>  



  <li>HW3, due Thurs, Feb 18th
    <ul>
    
    <li> Give an example of a statement which is independant of the incidence axioms
            which is shown to be independent by the model of the usual Euclidean plane and
            the integer lattice plane described in lecture.  Points = (a,b) with both a and b integers, lines are of the form (y-y0)=m(x-x0) where x0 and y0 are integers and m is rational, and vertical lines at x=n, for n an integer.    
    <li>
    Which of Hilbert's axioms hold for the integer lattice model of incidence geometry?
    You may assume that undefined terms in the integer lattice are interpreted the same way as in the Euclidean plane ("between", "same side", "congruent", etc.)
    and you may ignore the three-dimensional axioms that refer to planes and points in three-dimensional space.
    
   

   <li>
  Use calculus to find the geodesic from (0,-1) to (2,1) in the split plane geometry where
    distances below the x-axis are mulitplied by 1/2, but distances at or above the x-axis are unchanged.

    </ul>
