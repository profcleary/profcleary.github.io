<strong>Announcements: </strong>

<li> Exam 1 coming up, Wed 3/1.
<li> Some sample questions to help with preparing for that are <a href="x1questions.pdf">here as a PDF</a>.  Note that we haven't quite covered all the topics for questions there, so you can ignore for now questions about inversions, symmetry with respect to circles.

<li> Office hours Monday  2/27 moved to 9am due to meeting scheduled.
<li> Office hours Wednesday 2/15 moved to 9am due to meeting scheduled.
<li> Class meets Tuesday 2/21 as that is a CCNY "Tuesday=Monday" day.
<li> No class Mon 2/13 or Mon 2/20 as CUNY classes do not meet.
<li> Office hours Mon 2/6 moved to 5pm
<li> Quiz 0 and Quiz 1 on Blackboard due 2/6, now 9pm instead of 9am.
<li> Our scheduled classroom is 1/511E, the room to the right as you enter the Artino Lab.
<li> There are two straightforward quizzes on Blackboard which should be completed by Feb 6th at 9am.
<li> Students enrolled in the course should have gotten a Welcome email by Jan 18th.  If you are enrolled but did not get an email, make sure your CUNY First and Blackboard emails are set up properly.
<li> First homework assignment is due Wednesday, Feb 1st.
<li> First class meets Jan 25th.
<li> E. Abbott Abbott's Flatland is available online in many places, for example <a href="https://www.math.brown.edu/tbanchof/Flatland/welcome.html">here</a> or at <a href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/97">Project Gutenberg</a>.
<li> Euclid's Elements are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html">here</a>.
<li> Hilbert's Axioms are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_axioms">here</a>.
<li> Note that there are different editions of Stahl's book. You want the second edition, which has a greenish cover with yellow and has ISBN 978-0763753818, not the one with the blue cover which has an ISBN which ends in 202984.
<li> The Stahl book is unfortunately on the expensive side- there is a copy of the text on library reserve.  The first edition is available for much less expense but there are a few changes, including how exercises are grouped and the exercises themselves have been changed somewhat.
There are used copies available at <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=31016950695">ABE</a> and elsewhere.
