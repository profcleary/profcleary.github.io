<ul>

<li>  Tues, Feb 12: campus closed, classes do not meet.
<li>  There are two straighforward quizes (Quiz 0 and Quiz 1) on Blackboard which should be completed before the second week of class.
<li> <a href="https://kasperpeulen.github.io/">Euclid, The Game</a> is a GeoGebra set of challenges with ruler and compass construction challenges that may be a good review.
<li> There is a webpage with errata for the book <a href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~stahl/errata/poincare.pdf">here</a>
<li> First class meets Jan 29th in NAC 1511E, the Artino classroom.
<li> E. Abbott Abbott's Flatland is available online in many places, for example <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/">here</a>
<li> Euclid's Elements are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html">here</a>.
<li> Hilbert's Axioms are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_axioms">here</a>.
<li> Note that there are different editions of Stahl's book. You want the second edition, which has a greenish cover with yellow and has ISBN 978-0763753818, not the one with the blue cover which has an ISBN which ends in 202984.
<li> The Stahl book is expensive- there is a copy of the text on library reserve.  The first edition is available for much less expense but there are a few changes, including how exercises are grouped and the exercises themselves have been changed somewhat.
