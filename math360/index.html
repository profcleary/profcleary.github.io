<li> The plan is to meet in NAC 1/511E, the room to the right as you enter the Artino Lab.
<li> There are two straightforward quizzes on Blackboard which should be completed by Feb 3rd at 9am.
<li> Students enrolled in the course should have gotten a Welcome email by Jan 21st. If you are enrolled but did not get an email, make sure your CUNY First and Brightspace emails are set up properly.

<li> First class meets Jan 27th.
<li> E. Abbott Abbott's Flatland is available online in many places, for example <a href="https://www.math.brown.edu/tbanchof/Flatland/welcome.html">here</a> or at <a href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/97">Project Gutenberg</a>.
<li> Euclid's Elements are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html">here</a>.
<li> Hilbert's Axioms are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_axioms">here</a>.
<li> Note that there are different editions of Stahl's book. You want the second edition, which has a greenish cover with yellow and has ISBN 978-0763753818, not the one with the blue cover which has an ISBN which ends in 202984.
<li> There is a webpage with errata for the book <a href="errata.pdf">here</a>
<li> The Stahl book is unfortunately on the expensive side- there is a copy of the text on library reserve.  The first edition is available for much less expense but there are a few changes, including how exercises are grouped and the exercises themselves have been changed somewhat.
There are used copies available at <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/9780763753818/Gateway-Modern-Geometry-Poincare-Half-Plane-0763753815/plp">ABE</a> and elsewhere.
