<li> Some sample exam questions to help prepare for Exam 2 is <a href="x2questions.pdf">here</a>.
<li> Exam 2 coming up: will be April 22nd.
<li> The homework questions about circles are postponed until we have talked about circles in lecture more.
<li> There are some good examples of Frieze patterns at <a href="https://mathstat.slu.edu/escher/index.php/Frieze_Patterns">this site</a>.
<li> Exam 1 process: arrive at the start of class as usual, begin the Exam 1 on Blackboard, complete the exam by 12:15, then upload supporting materials to "Exam 1 Supporting Materials" as a scan or photo, with an image of your CCNY Photo ID visible on the first page.
<li> Kali is available as <a href="http://www.scienceu.com/geometry/handson/kali/kali.html">an applet</a> as well.
 <li> To help understand symmetry of figures, the Kali, KaleidoTile, and Kaleido Paint programs are available free at <a href="http://geometrygames.org/">geometrygames.org</a>
<li> Bonus office hours to prepare for exam 1: Tuesday, starting at 9:30am in our Blackboard course room.
<li> For exam 1, the Incidence Axioms, Euclid's Postulates, and Hilbert's Axioms will be provided if needed.
<li> There are some sample exam questions posted on Blackboard.
<li> There is a solution to the split plane geodesic problem posted on Blackboard.  Minimizing the distance is somewhat involved.
<li> There will be an exam Tues, March 2nd, covering the material up to 2.4.
<li> The <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/registrar/spring-2021-final-exam-schedule">Spring Final Schedule</a> is available.  Our final exam will be on Tuesday, May 25 from 8:00am to 10:15am.
<li> Attendance policy is: a student not present 5 minutes after class is scheduled to begin is marked "late" and one not present for half the class is marked "absent."  I believe things are configured correctly going forward now.
<li> Due to my misconfiguration of settings, all students present got at most a "50%" grade for attendance on lecture 1 as everyone (including me) was marked late.  I will correct that but I am not sure if it is possible to retroactive change
that on the Blackboard spreadsheet- even if it does not appear corrected there, I have recorded those as "100%" so do not worry.
<li> Lecture notes are posted on Blackboard under "Content"
<li> First class meets Feb 2nd.
<li> E. Abbott Abbott's Flatland is available online in many places, for example <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/">here</a>
<li> Euclid's Elements are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html">here</a>.
<li> Hilbert's Axioms are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_axioms">here</a>.
<li> Note that there are different editions of Stahl's book. You want the second edition, which has a greenish cover with yellow and has ISBN 978-0763753818, not the one with the blue cover which has an ISBN which ends in 202984.
<li> The Stahl book is expensive- there is a copy of the text on library reserve.  The first edition is available for much less expense but there are a few changes, including how exercises are grouped and the exercises themselves have been changed somewhat.
