<li> The question of integral right triangle lengths in UHP geometry is complicated- there is some nice work at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606700">this link</a> which gives some positive results for triangles with sides with lengths which are all logaritms of rational numbers, which is close to what came up in class.
<li> Here are some <a href="morequestions.pdf">more questions</a> to help prepare for the final, with some from earlier parts of the course.
<li> Math colloquium on Thurs, May 9th by Prof. Linda Keen on Geometry and Tilings in NAC 6114 at 12:30: <a href="http://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/seminar/show/7">details at this link</a>, 
Title: Geometry and Tiling, Abstract:  We will show how the basic question of how to lay tiles in a room leads mathematicians to interesting questions and new concepts in geometry.
<li> Final exam Thursday, May 16th 10:30am-12:45pm in our usual room.
<li> Not Knot is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd_HGjH7QZo">this link</a>
<li> Some of Escher's disk model prints are in the upper-half-plane model at <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1355197/plots">this link.</a>
<li> A few sample final exam questions for review are <a href="finrev360.pdf">here</a>.
<li> Final exam schedule: Thurs., May 16, 10:30am - 12:45pm, in our usual room
<li> Bonus office hours Monday, April 1, for students trying to decide about whether or not to drop before the deadline (4/1).
 <li> Exam 2 graded, scores on Blackboard.
<li> Clarification: Q6 on sample questions has "do not commute."  This is about order of operations: if the order does not matter (putting on shoes and shirt) the two operations commute.  If you get
different results with the two possible orders (putting on shoes and socks) then the two operations do not commute.
<li> Exam 2 is coming up, will cover up to 4.2.  Some sample exam questions are <a href="x2questions.pdf">here.</a>
<li> Bonus office hours Tuesday, March 12, 3:30pm, to help prepare for exam 2.
<li> I will be travelling and there will be no office hours Thurs 3/14 (Pi day) through 3/21. 

<li> There is a webpage in GeoGebra at <a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/InversionDemo.shtml">this link</a> which has a nice inversion applet.

<li> Exam 1 graded, scores on Blackboard.
<li> For exam 1, the Incidence Axioms, Euclid's Postulates, and Hilbert's Axioms will be provided if needed.

<li> There is a great Escher exhibit in Brooklyn, closes March 31st, with lots of nice symmetry artwork <a href="https://www.eschernyc.com">see link</a>
<li> Kali is available as <a href="http://www.scienceu.com/geometry/handson/kali/kali.html">an applet</a> as well.
 <li> To help understand symmetry of figures, the Kali, KaleidoTile, and Kaleido Paint programs are available free at <a href="http://geometrygames.org/">geometrygames.org</a>

<li> Bonus office hours to prepare for exam 1: Monday, Feb 25th 9:30am-11:30am, Tuesday,  Feb 26th, 3:30pm-4pm.
<li> Exam 1 coming up, Feb 28th, will cover up to 2.4.
<li>  <a href="http://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/seminar/show/7">Departmental colloq</a> Feb 7th, Prof. Akin talking about Intransitive Dice at 12:30PM in NAC 6/114.
<li>  Tues, Feb 12: campus closed, classes do not meet.
<li>  There are two straighforward quizes (Quiz 0 and Quiz 1) on Blackboard which should be completed before the second week of class.
<li> <a href="https://kasperpeulen.github.io/">Euclid, The Game</a> is a GeoGebra set of challenges with ruler and compass construction challenges that may be a good review.
<li> There is a webpage with errata for the book <a href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~stahl/errata/poincare.pdf">here</a>
<li> First class meets Jan 29th in NAC 1511E, the Artino classroom.
<li> E. Abbott Abbott's Flatland is available online in many places, for example <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/">here</a>
<li> Euclid's Elements are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html">here</a>.
<li> Hilbert's Axioms are available online in many places, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_axioms">here</a>.
<li> Note that there are different editions of Stahl's book. You want the second edition, which has a greenish cover with yellow and has ISBN 978-0763753818, not the one with the blue cover which has an ISBN which ends in 202984.
<li> The Stahl book is expensive- there is a copy of the text on library reserve.  The first edition is available for much less expense but there are a few changes, including how exercises are grouped and the exercises themselves have been changed somewhat.
