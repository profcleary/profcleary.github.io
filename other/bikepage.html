The purple bike on a ride out to Glacier Point in Yosemite.
<a href="GlacierPoint.html">See story</a> for details.
Katherine during the middle of a 120+ mile ride from Vermont
through Quebec and back into the states through New Hampshire.
This was before it started raining and before some of the
many moose sightings.  She is riding her wonderful green
Cannondale touring bike, which sometimes she lets me ride.
And K on a ride in the Sierra foothills above Sacramento.
Yes, she does own more than one T-shirt...

<p>
A view of the suspension stem on the old mountain bike.  The old
mountain bike admiring the view from Inspiration Point in the
San Gabriel mountains, just above Pasadena.  It isn't always that
clear there.
My mountain bike on the Black Rock desert playa in
northwestern Nevada.  This is one of the biggest playas I have
been on and was eerily empty and flat.  I rode my bike here  no hands for 2
miles in a straight line with my eyes closed.  I hope that is some kind
of record.

<p>

K on the Slickrock trail, near Moab UT around New Year's 1991(?).
Snow made some of the obstacles pretty interesting.

<p>

K surfing sandstone in a wash near Moab; wonderful winter
conditions and miles of rock.  And some snowy slickrock.

<p>

Amy and Joe riding in the Capay Valley, near Davis, and Joe and
I further up the valley as the road follows Cache Creek.  That
is a wonderful little road that follows a reasonable class III
kayak run.  For a while, after some storms and minor washouts,
the road was closed (to cars, presumably) and made an already
wonderful bike ride even better.  And Joe and I on the same
ride.

<p>

A gang of us about to head off on a mellow bike camp at Point Reyes.
We had a nice "heavyweight" bike camp there on the coast since the
route in is a pretty level, pretty smooth fireroad that lent itself
to heavily-laden bike travel.
K's father Bob
with his folder Bike Friday, trailer and plenty of gear at Point Reyes.
And Patty and I near Point Reyes, after riding up Bolinas Ridge and back.

 Arriving home on the commuter, an unoccupied tandem and the Bridgestone
 Radac and me on the unicycle.

<a href="../images/gretchen.jpg"><img src="../images/gretchen.tn.jpg" width=98 height=145 alt="Gretchen in Sullivan Canyon"></a>

<p> Leslie in Tilden Park, in Berkeley, with San Pablo Reservoir behind.
And Gretchen in Sullivan Canyon, in the Santa Monica mountains very
close to UCLA.  Sullivan Canyon really changes character from year
to year and with the seasons.  Sometimes the ride is mostly in
a rocky creekbed, and sometimes it's dry and a boring speed run.
One great thing about Berkeley and UCLA is that there
is wonderful biking very close.  There are great mountain bike rides
that you can just zip off and do in the evening or with no planning.
One problem with Fresno or Davis is that for most of the good mountain
biking, I generally put a bike on my car and drive for a while.

The folder unfolded, and folded.  Quite a nice little gadget.
And Dino, before the seat tube broke.
