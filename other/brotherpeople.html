My folks with Dennis at Hobart & William Smith Colleges for their last
Parents' Weekend.  Dennis, K, me, Matt, Tim and Laura at camp in Vermont,
and then Tim shaving in the car in Mobile.

There are always projects at camp, such as this deck project a few
summers ago.  Here we are planning it and then later finishing it off.

Dennis and Dad in California, and Sara, me, Dennis and Dad playing golf
in Alabama.  Golf seems to be the current family sport and it is
a reasonable way of getting to walk around together, look in the woods
for lost balls together, and so on.

At camp, we have an interesting
aquatic variation of golf, which involves trying to hit the floating
dock and then snorkeling to recover the balls.  I don't think it is going
to catch on nationally, but we have a blast doing it.  Here is Tim having
a go at it, and then me.  Usually there isn't someone standing on the
dock, but why should that stop the fun?  Matt asks: "Why should a little snow stop golf?"  When the lake is frozen, it means you don't need to snorkel
to find the balls, either.

Matt giving our dog a bath at camp in the summertime, and a gang of brothers
enjoying some wonderful wintertime conditions.  With a little luck, the lake can be
frozen with little enough snow to skate or bicycle on, and but enough to ski on.
And if the snow isn't too deep, there is of course, frozen lake golf.  White balls
are not a good choice for that...
