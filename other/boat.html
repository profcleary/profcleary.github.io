Our boat Deadwood, a 1975-ish Laser.  Simple to rig and a blast to sail,
it was a wonderful gift from K's family.

<p> Deadwood spends a lot of time capisized, because righting it
is so easy and fun.  When it is capsized, the boat is so bouyant that
the cockpit is above waterline so it is completely dry when righted.
Here are Meg and I relaxing after having
capsized the boat in the frigid waters of high-altitude
Huntington Lake.

<p> One fun game to play is to try and dump the boat by lurching about
in a manner so as to capsize the boat and dunk the other sailor without
getting wet yourself.  Here are Meg and I playing this game.  Meg
has very good balance so usually I get wet.  This shot was taken from
the mighty ship Jack.

Here is the boat just after being righted, as photographed from Jack.
With reasonable balance, you can right the boat and be positioned to
start sailing right off.  When I meet other Laser sailors, sometimes
I challenge them to a capsize race- who can capsize and right the
boat five times fastest.  I haven't lost yet.  Then again, nobody
has accepted the challenge yet...

<p>
This is C-shell, an Optimist Pram-imitation boat.  Yes, I know that that
is the geekiest Unix name possible for a boat, but it was named this in
1974 (was there Unix then?) and the C is for Cleary.  My brother Tim and I combined
our assets and bought it for the mind-bogglingly huge sum of
$50.  At the time, our allowances were 9 cents and 7 cents a week (our
ages in pennies) so my father arranged an installment plan for us to pay
it off.  I hope never to be so indebted again, at least relative to my
income!  C-shell is a pokey little boat but is simple to rig and sail.
Two friendly grownups can squeeze into in, but mostly for comedy value.
Many, many people have learned to sail in it!

<p>
This is Meg and Jan's
wonderful boat, Wedgie, a Laser 2.  Unfortunately, on this particular
day on Los Banos Reservoir, there was absolutely no wind.  But the
light was nice and the company wonderful.

<p>
Here are Wedgie and Deadwood on Lexington Reservoir near Los Gatos, a fun
place to sail where the water is usually pretty warm.

<p>
Here is Joel, before a run down a class II stretch of the
Bear River in the general vicinity of the town of  Colfax.
This was a nice run but arranging the shuttle and takeout were
a bit of a hassle.  We know of no publically accessible takeout
below the lower part of the run.  The takeout near the middle
has had vandalism problems from locals, so we asked permission from someone
who had a place on the lake further downstream.  Actually, I was elected to
ask permission since I was the most-respectable looking of the
lot of us, which is a scary thought.  In any case, it was a nice
run and worked well with a bike shuttle.

<p>

K and I found a cheap, lightly used Hobie 16 catamaran here in Fresno and
decided to take it up to Vermont for my family to use up at camp.  My
folks used to be regular sailors, but the boat we have up at camp is
pretty solid and stable (in other words, slow and boring) so interest
in sailing has
waned, particularly with some motorboats there for amusement.  We're
hoping everyone will like the Hobie and we think it is great fun.
Here I am puttering with it in Vermont, and it tied up at sunset.
Notice the very 1970's colors!

<p>
We did have to trailer the Hobie to Vermont, and it is much larger boat
than Deadwood so that was a trip without much manoeverability. 
Here we are with about 50 feet of vehicle in Tappen, North Dakota on
our way across, and here is my father in Ohio using some remarkable polishing
compound to see what the hulls really look like.

<p>
Dulcinea is our family's beloved sloop, of the Interlake design, which is
popular in the midwest and was pretty much designed to sail on Lake Erie.
It is a very stable boat and great fun to poke around in.  Here is
Dulcinea sailing up on Maidstone Lake.
