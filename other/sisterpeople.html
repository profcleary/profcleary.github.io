Katherine, Amy, and Meg in the rain at New Year's in Fresno.
Beth for some reason didn't want to come walking in the rain.

<p> Here are K's sisters and I playing "I Doubt It", a card game
at which I have no chance against them because it involves keeping
a straight face.  They suspect I might have put
down a few more cards than I claimed...

<a href="../images/btbmm.jpg"><img src="../images/btbmm.tn.jpg" width=153 height=117 alt="Meg, K and green M&M"></a>
<p> Meg and I juggling in Cupertino, and Katherine and Meg with a huge
green M&M, after running Bay to Breakers in San Francisco.  We had
convinced Meg there wouldn't actually be any running, since it would
be too crowded with 100,00 other people there, and then we
accidently turned up 2 hours early and
ended up running since those 100,000 people were mostly behind us (having
gotten up at a decent hour.)  That was about five years
ago and I think Meg still is sore from that.

<p>
Bob with his folder, its trailer and plenty of camping gear at Point
Reyes, and Meg and Amy in the snow atop Big Baldy peak in Sequioa.
And this is what you find when you get your pictures back if you foolishly
leave Meg alone in a room with your camera.

Katherine still looking patient after hearing me reminisce about college
at Cornell, and Meg blasting homewards at Badger Pass.  Katherine and Meg sitting on top
of a brass pig in Seattle.

K biking in Quebec in her favorite T-shirt, a gang of heavily-laden
bike campers about to head out at Point Reyes, and 
K and Doug at a little
waterfall near Mount Charleston, Nevada.

<p>

Sean and Katherine with a huge prairie dog.  The prairie dog is the
one in the back.  Sean at Devil's Tower, looking routes he'd like to do
if only the temperature were above freezing.  And Sean carrying
more gear than could possibly go into any single pitch at Tollhouse.
