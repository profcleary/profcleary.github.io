Via Aqua is a 6 pitch climb in Yosemite rated 5.7.  It lies on the
upper part of the wall to the left of Upper Yosemite Falls.
The approach is up the Upper Yosemite Falls
Trail, gaining a fair amount of elevation on the switchbacks.
We got a reasonably early start from Fresno and were hiking up
by about 7am.  I hadn't been in the Valley since the January floods
and was surprised that the effects weren't more noticable as
we drove in.  There was quite a lot of silt around and plenty of signs of recent
construction and repair, though.

The approach ledge is a pretty spectacular little scramble, which starts
from just before the uppermost switchbacks of the trail.  Sam had been
out the ledge before when he did Via Aqua a few years ago so we had
no problem finding the start of the ledge.  Interestingly,
Steve Roper in the old Sierra Club Yosemite guidebook gives the
approach ledge as a characteristic example of third class terrain.
The ledge is spectacularly exposed above the falls and though for the most
part the going is pretty straightforward, there are a few trickier spots.
The left image is
Nancy making an airy step across a void enroute to the base of the route,
which is visible as the broken ledges in the middle of the picture.
The middle image is a view including some of the falls below us
and the right image is the start of the route.
The route is somewhat but not completely protected
from the spray of the falls by a buttress, as the climb starts in the
left facing open book in the middle of the picture.

<p>
We climbed as a party of 3 on double ropes, which worked smoothly.
Sam led on the double 9mm's and Nancy and I followed with
packs, each on
separate ropes.  There was a little tangling at the
more crowded belays but it worked nicely overall.  The climbing was
enjoyable relatively clean cracks, mostly.  There was a short steep
section with some harder moves but it is possible the
route may have gone a little to the right there.  There were some
nice moves on very steep rock with positive flakes on the third pitch.
A couple of pitches up and the difficulties are mostly over.

On the left, Sam is about to traverse
across a ledge to set up a belay below
what will prove to be a tricky strenuous chimney pitch. Nice views
across the valley from here, including of course Half Dome.
In the middle is Sam moving the belay over.  It was a little windy and there was some
spray here.
And on the right, 
Nancy follows Sam.   It was pretty interesting being near the
falls and exposed here.

Obligatory tourist shot from the top of the falls.  This is not a view
you want to see from a kayak, by the way.
