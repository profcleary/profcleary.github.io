Kings Canyon National Park in California lies in two pieces.
There is a piece outside the canyon at 6000'+ elevation with
remarkable giant sequoias and there is the piece which contains
part of Kings Canyon proper and the high peaks.  The road
connecting the two pieces runs through Sequoia National Forest
land and "is not plowed" in the winter.  But the road is
actually plowed, at least from time to time.  Furthermore, from
the point where the locked gate blocks the road (at about 5800')
the road is often clear of snow because the elevation is lower
and the weather warmer.  So the idea was to drive to near the
gate, and then bicycle down into the canyon and then explore it
in relative solitude before riding back up to my truck.  I
decided to go after some cool rainy weather in the nearby
Central Valley, which was followed by warmer sunny weather.

The ride started out wonderfully, since the road drops from
5800' to 3000' with spectacular vistas regularly.  Though the
road wasn't open to cars, it looked like the potentially snowy
parts had been plowed within a week or so.  Most of the road was
clear of snow, though there were some wet parts and some icy
parts since it was before 9am and still pretty cool out.  I
couldn't go too fast on this descent because of the icy bits and
because there are a number of small rockslides that left rocks
in the road, some as large as sheep or so.  Even on the clearer
stretches I couldn't go too fast, since there was a lot of
gravel and residue on the road, probably due in part to the fact
that there isn't the steady stream of traffic to clear the road
of tiny debris.  But it was beautiful and I saw nobody at all.
I've always liked riding on paved roads covered with leaves and
pine needles.  I was a little cold on the descent despite
tights, shorts and thin wool pants with a wool top and jacket,
but it is hard to keep warm when coasting.

There were plenty of aging yucca blooms.  I used to ride often
in the Angeles National Forest near LA and always enjoyed the
towering yucca blooms there in the spring, especially when they first
came up.  There is a small lodge in the national forest part but
that looked deserted.   Somebody had left a highway-type sign
"Caution Ice- cream crossing ahead" so I got the impression the
people who plowed the road and minded the lodge had some fun...
I scared myself a bit by picking up some speed and then coming
around a corner to find a bunch of helmet sized rocks blocking
the road.  I was able to thread my way between them but resolved
to slow down when I couldn't see very far ahead.

Near the bottom of the road is the most spectacular part, with
the road clinging to the canyon wall as it follows a remarkable
horseshoe bend along the river.  The Kings river was flowing
very well there with some snowmelt and the canyon walls are
pretty impressive there.  Right where the road crosses the river
is Boyden Cave, but a little exploration convinced me that it
was closed up tightly for the season.  The road began going
uphill along the river but climbed pretty gradually.  The
waterfalls were flowing very nicely and the river looked great.
As I got further up the canyon and into Kings Canyon NP, there
started to be patches of snow.  Though the elevation is lower
(~4000') the canyon and the forest shade the road so there were
places where the soft snow was a couple of inches deep.  Riding
in snow isn't too bad, though a prolonged gentle uphill is hard
to sustain.  But at first the snowy patches were not often
longer than a few hundred meters, so that was no problem.  After
entering the park, I did see some human footprints in the snow
but not very fresh ones and no other signs of anyone.  The
canyon was great; in the summer, this area is blistering hot and
crawling with tourists and RV's.  But I had the place to myself
and there were tons of small animals around.  I saw one larger
cat; either it was a very large bobcat or a smaller mountain
lion but I saw no deer or sheep.  The river and falls and
forests were great.  The snow got to be more continuous after a
while, with longer pushes through soft snow.  But there were
still the occasional ridable patches, which went much quicker
than the pushing!  The snow was too soft to ride on top of; the
pedals would hit the snow hard enough to make riding uphill
difficult.  But it wasn't too bad.  I stopped up past Cedar
Grove but still a couple of miles from the road's end because
the ridable patches were pretty much disappearing.  I had a nice
lunch and started working my way back down through the snow.
Gentle downhills on soft snow like that are pretty manageable so
that worked well, although it is much harder work than riding
downhill on dry pavement!  Once I got back to the places where
there were long stretches of ridable stuff, I could relax and
roll downhill and let my stomach digest its lunch since climbing
back to the truck was going to be a lot of work.

Climbing up was slow going but pretty enjoyable.  On the way
down, this stretch seemed to have tons of rocks on it; on the
way up, they seemed pretty sparse.  I guess that isn't
surprising considering at 36mph things come up much faster than
at 6mph.   I had stashed a liter of water partway along the
road, so that I didn't worry about running out.  But I didn't
put it in a prominent enough spot to keep me from worrying about
missing it.  I did find it easily, but I had worried about
having gone by it for a while before it looked like the right
place.  I should have left it near a more prominent feature like
a sign or a such instead of leaving it at a spectacular
viewpoint, since there were many of those.

<p>
It got a bit cloudier on the way up, but I was still warm from
going uphill and was down to wool top and shorts except when I
stopped to rest.  I was making pretty steady progress but got
disappointed in myself when I accidentally fell asleep at
viewpoint I'd stopped to rest at.  I don't know how long I
slept; it wasn't that long but still it was a mistake that could
have been serious.  I was making nice progress upwards and there
were spectacular views to the east of the higher peaks in the
Sierra, including a number I've been up from the east side.  As
I got up past 5000', there were wet spots from the melting snow
and things were a little cooler and breezier, enough to warrant
tights again.  Then after some more climbing, I heard the shouts
of kids playing in the snow and knew I wasn't far from the
gate.  Despite my nap, I still managed to get back to the truck
by 4pm, so I was happy with how hard I'd been working.

My bike is a wonderful Bridgestone XO-2, which is everything a
"hybrid" should be but usually isn't.  26" wheels with 1.4"
slicks will go anywhere except very soft stuff that needs
flotation.  And the "dirt drop" bars are great on pavement or
rougher stuff.  I took a pannier full of clothes, lunch and gear
so I was ready for harsher conditions than turned up.  I like
riding this bike anywhere and I'm particularly happy when I can
use it riding to places where a skinny tired bike would struggle
or far enough that a fat tired upright bike would be too much
work.

<p>
Ride data: 61 miles, ~4500' gain: 5800' -> 3000' -> 4700' and the reverse
           left at 8am, back by 4pm.

<h3> Update </h3>

The January 1997 warm winter storms damaged the road considerably.
There were pictures in the Fresno Bee of large bulldozers and
heavy equipment beginning repairs on sections of the road which
were heavily damaged.  I expect it will be a while before the
road is in reasonable shape.

Also, I have heard that the amount of plowing varies from year to
year and depends of course on the current conditions.  I shouldn't
need to remind anyone that once in the park, riding is allowed only
on the paved roads.  For current conditions info, evidently
 a good place to call
is the Sierra NF folks at: (209)338-2251
