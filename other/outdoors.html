<p>

Mount Shasta at sunset, from the east, after a very wet
spring for Northern California.  I had tried a route on the southeast
side earlier that day but was turned back by very wet slushy snow

width=80 height=117 alt="bike in desert"></a>

<p> My mountain bike on the Black Rock desert playa in
northwestern Nevada.  This is one of the biggest playas I have
been on and was eerily empty and flat.  I rode my bike here  no hands for 2
miles in a straight line with my eyes closed.  I hope that is some kind
of record.

Near the brink
of Chilnualna Falls in Yosemite, a couple of days before the
big Yosemite floods of January 1997.

<p>
In Little Death Hollow, in the San Rafael Swell, southern Utah.  This was a
nice narrow canyon with a few places that required scrambling.
There was lots of petrified wood in the area.

<a href="../images/elcap.jpg"><img src="../images/elcap.tn.jpg"
width=118 height=79 alt="El Cap from HCS"></a>

<p>
El Capitan from the summit of Higher Cathedral Spire.  The
East Buttress route (IV, 5.10b) lies on the right hand side of the photo.
The beginning of the climb is at the end of the line of
bushes that go from the middle of the right hand part of the
face and eventually end.
It is very obvious from this angle how much shorter the
East Buttress route is than a real El Cap route, like the Nose.

<p>
A wonderful sunset from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.
I smugly assured K that the chance that this picture would
come out was zero, but she was persistent...

<p>

The Colorado River from a nice spot near the North Rim.

<a href="../images/snowplant.jpg"><img src="../images/snowplant.tn.jpg" width=98 height=145 alt="snowplant- weird"></a>
<p>

Poppies blooming in the Antelope Valley during a good year, and the strange
snowplant which is common to many forested parts of the western Sierra
in late spring.  It still seems wierd to me that there is really no
part of this flower which is green.

<a href="../images/snowflake.jpg"><img src="../images/snowflake.tn.jpg" width=99 height=107  alt="starfish on Big Baldy"></a>
<p>
A couple of starfish on Big Baldy in Sequoia NP in blowing snow.

<a href="../images/h.pali.jpg"><img src="../images/h.pali.tn.jpg" width=146 heig

<p>
Sun lighting the Na Pali coast on Kauai, a few months before
Iniki rearranged things a bit.

<a href="../images/zion.narrowsme.jpg"><img src="../images/zion.narrowsme.tn.jpg" width=99 height=145 alt="looking up for photo"></a>
<p>
Two parts of the Narrows in Zion.

<a href="../images/shasta.doug.jpg"><img src="../images/shasta.doug.tn.jpg" width=123 height=171 alt="Doug on glacier"></a>
<p>
Doug making progress up the Hotlum-Bolam route on Shasta in October,
after the first fall storm left a few inches of snow there.  We had
spent the previous night in the tent on a rather small platform that
we tramped out.

<p>
<a href="../images/gould.jpg"><img src="../images/gould.tn.jpg" width=146 height=99 alt="view from Mt. Gould"></a>
<a href="../images/kearfin.jpg"><img src="../images/kearfin.tn.jpg" width=98 height=143 alt="thin fin"></a>
<p>
The view from Mt. Gould, a good view-to-difficulty ratio peak very
close to Onion Valley.  And an edgewise-view of the fin-like feature
just south of Kearsarge Pass.  I think Roper called it class 3, but
it looked harder than that when I was over there.

<a href="../images/parun.me.jpg"><img src="../images/parun.me.tn.jpg" width=145 height=99 alt="Sean wades Virgin"></a>
<p>
Parunaweap Canyon is a good narrow canyon of the east fork of the Virgin River,
partly in Zion.  Here is a log still wedged from earlier flooding, some
narrower bits, and a staged self-portrait.  At the water levels I was at,
there were no mandatory rappels, swims or roped climbing, though there was
some scrambling and there were some shoulder-deep bits. I understand that
canyon has been closed to vistors now.

Delicate Arch with Katherine in the obligatory spot.
