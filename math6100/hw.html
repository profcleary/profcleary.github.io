<strong> Dr. Cleary's Math A6100 Homework Assignments: </strong> <br> <br>

<ul>

<li>HW1, due Thurs, Feb 3rd
<ol>
<li> (basically 1.1.7 from Pressley) Parameterize a cycloid: the path of a point on the circumference
of a circle of radius a as it rolls without slipping along the positive x-axis.
<li> (basically 1.1.7 from Pressley, continued) Parameterize the path of a point at distance b from
the center of disk of radius a as it rolls without slipping along the positive x-axis.
<li>  Parameterize the path of a point on the circumference
of a circle of radius a as it rolls without slipping around the outside of another circle of radius a.  You may want
to experiment with coins to understand the behavior before parameterizing.
</ol>

<li> HW2, due <s>Tues, Feb 8th</s> Thurs Feb 10th
<ul> <li> Problems 1.2.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3 and 1.4.3 from Pressley
</ul>




<li> HW3, due Thurs, Feb 17th
<ul> <li> Find the curvature of the curve paramtererized as x(t)=t,y(t)=t,z(t)=1+t^2.
<li> 2.1.1 #iii, #iv
<li> 2.2.6
<li> 2.3.1 (missing comma in (i) separating the x and y components)
<li> 2.3.2
</ul>


<li> HW4, due  Thurs, Feb 24th

<ul>  <li> Find the curvature of the curve paramtererized as x(s)=cos(s)/sqrt(2),y(s)=sin(s),z(s)= cos(s)/sqrt(2) and identify the curve.
<li> Spinning around a curve: If a rigid body moves along a unit speed curve gamma (s), we can
describe its motion as a translation along s and a rotation around the curve. This rotation is
determined by an angular momentum vector w which satisfies T' = w x T, N' = w x N and B' = w x B. Show that
w= tau T + kappa B by expressing w in terms of the basis (T,N,B) and solving.
<li> Compute T, N and B for the curve x(t)= e^t cos(t), y(t)=e^t sin(t), z(t)=e^t, and the curvature and torision of the curve.
<li> Use Green's Theorem to find the area of the ellipse with axes of lengths 2p and 2q and then do 3.2.2

</ul>



<li> HW5, due Thurs, Mar 3rd (day of exam 1)
<ul> 
<li> Use the stereographic projection method descibed in class to give two coordinate charts for the unit sphere.
<li> 4.1.2- don't actually do the problem, just find the transition function sigma z + to sigma y -.
<li> 4.1.3
</ul>

<ul> 
<li> 4.2.6
<li> 4.4.1, 4.5.1

<ul> 
<li> 6.2.2
<li> Show that Mercator's parameterization of the sphere <tt> (sech (u) cos(v), sech(u) sin(v), tanh(u)) </tt>  is conformal.
<li> Consider the surface of revolution obtained by rotating the curve x=x(t) > 0 , z=z(t) around the z-axis.
Comupute its first fundamental form and show that the curves of constant t and theta are always orthogonal.  Is this parameterization always a conformal map from the plane?
