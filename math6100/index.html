<li> There is a talk at 3:30pm on Thursday that I would like to be able to attend, so the plan is for me to run a bit long on Tuesday in anticipation of ending class a bit early on Thursday.
<lI> The deadline for Quiz0 on Blackboard has been extended a few days until next week.  Please let  me know if you have any difficulty.
<li> There are several students interested in auditing the class- attending the course though not enrolled, to learn the material.  If anyone has any objection to my permitting auditors to attend, please let me know.
<li> Students enrolled in the course should have received a "Welcome email." If you did not get one, make sure that your CUNY Blackboard email address is correct.
<li> There is a straightforward Quiz0 on Blackboard due Feb 10th, but it is easy and should be done well before then.
<li> The Blackboard pages for this course should be available to all students now.
<li> Tuesday, Feb 8th: Friday classes meet instead of Tuesday classes, so we do not have class.
<li> The process for CCNY students to get Mathematica is described <a href="https://support.ccny.cuny.edu/software/BETA_CityCollege_UNL_Website.html">here</a>.  The CUNY site license allows free student use of the full version.
<li> Note: we will be using the 2nd edition of Pressley (the current one.)  The title is in red letters on the cover, whereas the old edition had blue letters for the title, an easy way to tell them apart.
<li> First class meets Feb 1st, in the Artino classroom in NAC 1511E.  It is a little hard to find and involves going down a long cinderblock cooridor.
<li> E. Abbott Abbott's Flatland is available online free in many places, for example <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/">here</a>
