<li> The video lessons from the old Math 202 course are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-202-video-lessons/">here</a>.  Good places to start are Lesson 2 and Lesson 8 which correspond to where we are starting.
<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">Math 212 page</a> including some review material which may be helpful.

<li> First class meets Aug 25th.
<li> The prerequisite topics are those in Math 201 as taught at CCNY since Fall 2019- see <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/201+syllabus_CLO_spring20.pdf">this description of 201 topics</a>. 
If you are missing some of those topics from taking a course which is judged equivalent
(generally having about 80% of the topics) it is a good idea to fill those gaps before the term starts as it will be difficult to pass the class without mastery of
topics from 201 including <ul>
<li>Trig and exponential functions and their inverses
<li>Differentiation, optimization, max/min word problems
<li>Integration, Fundamental Theorem of Integral Calculus
<li>Substitution as an integration technique</ul>
<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201 and 202.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a supplement.
