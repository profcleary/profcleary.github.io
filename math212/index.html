<li> Registration information for the online system from Pearson, the publisher of the text, is available <a href="MyLabReg212PR.pdf">here</a>.  You will need this to complete the homework.
<li> First class meets Feb 2nd.
<li> The prerequisite topics are those in Math 201 as taught at CCNY since Fall 2019- see <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/201+syllabus_CLO_spring20.pdf">this description of 201 topics</a>. 
If you are missing some of those topics from taking a course which is judged equivalent
(generally having about 80% of the topics) it is a good idea to fill those gaps before the term starts as it will be difficult to pass the class without mastery of
topics from 201 including <ul>
<li>Trig and exponential functions and their inverses
<li>Differentiation, optimization, max/min word problems
<li>Integration, Fundamental Theorem of Integral Calculus
<li>Substitution as an integration technique</ul>
<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201 and 202.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a supplement.
