<strong>Announcements: </strong>
<ul>

<li> Please use the appropriate Blackboard discussion boards for general questions that may be of interest to other students as described in lecture.
<li> Well done to those who have gotten started on the MyLab assignments.  If you are a student with the free trial "unpaid access" keep an eye on when the expiration date is on your trial and make sure to complete your Pearson purchase by then.
<li> First Mylab assignments not due until Sept 13th 11am, but there are many due that day so get started soon.
<li> Lecture notes posted on Blackboard under "Content"
<li> Class meets on Blackboard Collaborate.
<li> The  <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/registrar/fall-2021-final-exam-schedule">CCNY final exam schedule</a> does not yet have confirmed dates for Mathematics Department group finals but those will be confirmed in due course.

<li> Questions about administrative aspects of the course or specific mathematical topics are generally best posted in the appropriate Blackboard discussion board, as that way others can either answer them or benefit from responses.

<li> An introductory quiz "Quiz0" is available on Blackboard and should be completed by Sept. 7th.

<li> First lecture is Wednesday, Aug 25th.

<li> Instructions for enrolling in the Mylab course have been emailed to enrolled students.  If you have already recently purchased the correct version of the text for CCNY Math 201 or elsewhere, you should not need to purchase it again and should be able to complete your Mylab enrollment already.

<li>A "Welcome" message has been emailed to all enrolled students.  If you did not get such an email, make sure that your Blackboard and CUNY First email addresses are set to places that you check.

<li> We will be using the Pearson MyLab system for the text and online homework assignments.  I will send instructions but if you already have purchased an electronic or loose-leaf version of the Thomas' Calculus 14th edition Early Transcendentals text, for example for CCNY Math 201, you shouldn't need to purchase anything new.  If not, CCNY has arranged for electronic or loose-leaf text purchase both of which include electronic access to MyLab for the homework system.  There will be instructions sent to enrolled students for those which are about $80 for the electronic version, or about $115 for the looseleaf paper copy,  both including required MyLab homework system access.
<li> The video lessons from the old Math 202 course are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-202-video-lessons/">here</a>.  Good places to start are Lesson 2 and Lesson 8 which correspond to about where we are starting.
<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">Math 212 page</a> including some review material which may be helpful.

<li> First class meets Aug 25th.
<li> The prerequisite topics are those in Math 201 as taught at CCNY since Fall 2019- see <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/201+syllabus_CLO_spring20.pdf">this description of 201 topics</a>. 
If you are missing some of those topics from taking a course which is judged equivalent
(generally having about 80% of the topics) it is a good idea to fill those gaps before the term starts as it will be difficult to pass the class without mastery of
topics from 201 including <ul>
<li>Trig and exponential functions and their inverses
<li>Differentiation, optimization, max/min word problems
<li>Integration, Fundamental Theorem of Integral Calculus
<li>Substitution as an integration technique</ul>
<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201 and 202.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a review or supplement.
<li> A sample final from Math 201 is available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/Sample+Math+201+Online+Final+Exam+Questions.pdf">here.</a>
