<li> Office hours on reading day May 18th 9:30am-11am on Blackboard.
<li > There are old 202 and 203 final exams to help prepare available <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-20200/">202 finals</a> and <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-20300/">203 finals</a>.  Though some of the topics are not covered in 212, pretty much all the topics in 212 are covered in one of 202 and 203.


<li> A nice plot of the function with the same limit along all lines but not the parabolic approach is at <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~tom.vogel/gallery/node15.html">this link</a>
<li> We didn't finish 14.2 in lecture on Tuesday so that homework is postponed until May 11th.
<li> Exam 3 will begin at 2:20pm and run for 80 minutes until 3:40pm.
<li> Topics on functions of several variables are covered in lectures 11 through 14 from <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">the 203 lectures page</a> of Dr. Marchese and me.
<li> Topics for Exam 3 are those up to 12.6, Cylinders and Quadric Surfaces
<li> HW on 14.1 is postponed until after Exam 3.
 <li> Topics on cylinders and quadric surfaces are covered in lectures 7 and 8 from <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">the 203 lectures page</a> of Dr. Marchese and me.

<li> HW on 12.6 is postponed to Apr 27th as we haven't finished talking about quadric surfaces yet.
<li> Topics on space, vectors. vector operations, lines, and planes are covered in lectures 1 through 6 from <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">the 203 lectures page</a> of Dr. Marchese and me.
<li> Homework that was originally 
<li> Exam 3 is coming up: will be April 29th.  Topics will include those from 10.8 (Taylor Series) onward.  Note that in order to be comfortable with Taylor series, you need mastery of the series convergence tests from throughout Chapter 8.
<li> In response to some student requests for review material on the Pearson system, there are two COMPLETELY OPTIONAL quizzes set up on the Pearson system with questions from integration and series sections.  It should be set up so that students can take them more than once.  The scores will not count but it may be a way to practice material.
<li> We are beginning Ch 12 after a bit on parametric curves in Ch 11.  
<li> Exam 2 is planned to run from 2:25 to 3:40 after a short lecture.
<li> Topics on Taylor and Maclaurin series and Taylor polynomials and applications are covered in lectures 33, 34, and 35 from <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">the 203 lectures page</a> of Dr. Marchese and me.
<li> Homework that was originally due Mar 18 postponed to allow for more exam preparation.
<li> There are many integrals to practice on the old <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-20200/">Math 202</a> page and
many series to practice on the the old <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-20300/">Math 203</a> page, in the
form of previous final exams.
<li> Topics for exam 2 are those up to 10.7, Power Series.


<li> The beginnings of power series are in Lecture 32 from <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">the old 203 lectures page</a>.

<li> Exam 2 planned for Thursday, March 18th.

<li> Topics for recent lectures are in Lecture 31 from <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">the old 203 lectures page</a>.

<li> The <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/registrar/spring-2021-final-exam-schedule">Spring Final Schedule</a> is available.  Our final exam will be a departmental one on Tuesday, May 25 from 1:00 pm - 3:15 pm.
<li> We are moving into Chapter 10, Sequences and Series.  The relevant lectures from Dr. Marchese for Feb 23rd are Lectures 29 and 30 from <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-203-video-lessons/">the old 203 lectures page</a>.

<li> For the exam, there will be no ancillary electronic devices or computer programs, apps, or sites allowed. You may not use any tablets, smart watches, calculators, etc., in addition to the device on which you are taking the exam, and you may not have any browsers or applications open other than the Blackboard platform in which you will be taking the exam. You may also not have the book or notes open, nor seek the help of any human being or other resources (present or via electronic communication).

<li> You should have the capability of uploading your work in support of the exam.  That is most likely photos or scans of handwritten scratch paper.  This will need to be submitted shortly after the exam concludes.  There is a fake assignment on Blackboard to practice uploading if you have concerns about your ability to do this shortly after the exam concludes.

<li> The first exam is postponed to Thursday, Feb 25th.  It still will cover the same topics: all of them up to and including 8.5, Partial Fractions.  The exam will be about 45 minutes and begin at the beginning of the class period, on Blackboard.  That will be followed with more lecture on new material.
<li> There are office hours on Tuesday at 10am for exam review.
<li> Attendance is calculated by Blackboard.  The settings are that you must be present (logged in) for at least 50% of the lecture to avoid absence.  If you are disconnected and return, you should get marked as present as long as you were connected for at least 50% of the lecture and not more than 30 minutes late.
<li> The participation grade is based on all class participation including responses during lecture, chat during lecture, and the discussion board. 
<li> There is a Discussion Board on Blackboard to ask and answer questions about 212 material.
<li> Topics for lecture 5 are from 8.5 and 8.7 principally. The relevant lectures from Dr. Marchese is Lectures 13 and 14, available at this <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-202-video-lessons/">page</a>.
<li> Short exam planned for Tues, Feb 23rd.
<li> Topics for lecture 4 are from 8.4 principally. The relevant lecture from Dr. Marchese is Lecture 12, available at this <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-202-video-lessons/">page</a>.
<li> For those having connectivity issues, the campus has loaner equipment readily available that may help.
<li> Note how many attempts are permitted on the Pearson homework assignments as it is often limited.  Students who need more than 4 attempts are spending four times as much time on the homework as necessary and likely have some issue with the underlying material and perhaps time would be better spent reading the text, reviewing notes, or seeing the supplementary video lessons.
<li> With all the trig substitutions, it may be helpful to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAkMUdeB06o">visualize the Pythagorean theorem</a> nicely.
<li> Topics for lecture 3 are from 8.3 and 8.4.   Relevant lectures from Dr. Marchese include Lectures 11 and 12, available at this <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-202-video-lessons/">page</a>
<li> Topics for lecture 2 are from 8.1 and 8.2, as mentioned in class.  Relevant lectures from Dr. Marchese include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFxmL23KmyA&feature=youtu.be">Lesson 10: integration by parts</a> with <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/Calc+II+Lesson+10+Integration+by+Parts.pdf">notes</a>
<li> A table of basic integrals from the text is <a href="BasicIntegrals.png">here</a>
<li> For those interested in applications of the hyperbolic trig functions, see <a href="http://calculuscourse.maa.org/sample/Chapter5/Projects/Inverse%20Hyperbolic%20Functions/hyperbolic2.html">this page</a> about the St. Louis Gateway arch, or the part of <a href="https://mathstat.slu.edu/escher/index.php/The_Geometry_of_Antoni_Gaudi">this page</a> which is about the caternary curves used by Antonin Gaudi in the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona.
<li> PDF notes from lecture 1 are posted on Blackboard.  A video lecture on hyperbolic functions is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJINhx950hg&feature=youtu.be">here</a> with coordinated notes <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/Calc+II+Lesson+08+Hyperbolic+Functions.pdf">here</a>.
<li> The video lessons from the old Math 202 course are <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/page/math-202-video-lessons/">here</a>.  Good places to start are Lesson 2 and Lesson 8 which correspond to where we are starting.
<li> There are some resources at the departmental <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/course/math-21200/">Math 212 page</a> including some review material which may be helpful.
<li> If you have not gotten any welcome email announcements, please make sure that you are registered for the course and that you are checking the relevant email account.
<li> Registration information for the online system from Pearson, the publisher of the text, is available <a href="MyLabReg212PRrev.pdf">here</a>.  You will need this to complete the homework.
<li> First class meets Feb 2nd.
<li> The prerequisite topics are those in Math 201 as taught at CCNY since Fall 2019- see <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/201+syllabus_CLO_spring20.pdf">this description of 201 topics</a>. 
If you are missing some of those topics from taking a course which is judged equivalent
(generally having about 80% of the topics) it is a good idea to fill those gaps before the term starts as it will be difficult to pass the class without mastery of
topics from 201 including <ul>
<li>Trig and exponential functions and their inverses
<li>Differentiation, optimization, max/min word problems
<li>Integration, Fundamental Theorem of Integral Calculus
<li>Substitution as an integration technique</ul>
<li> There are some helpful videos from Dr. Marchese at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_mgg5tXbJ7oi_fGKtPvEg">
this YouTube channel</a> which cover material from old 201 and 202.  These can be very helpful either to fill in gaps in preparation
(for example for those who took calculus elsewhere and may be missing some topics) or as a supplement.
