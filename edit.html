<h1> Mathematical Calisthenics: Healthy for Everyone </h1>

<p>
Mathematics is the language of science.   Scientists and
engineers need to understand mathematical tools and reasoning.
Otherwise, bridges fall down.  But mathematical skills are
essential for everyone in a modern society, not just the
scientific elite.  Often, decisions about risk or daily life
require a certain mathematical analysis.  Furthermore, people
judge us by our ability to present logical arguments-
mathematics gives us the practice we need to think and argue
lucidly.

Albania's recent civil unrest and great financial collapse are
largely due to failures of mathematical understanding.
Pyramid schemes are a financial version of chain letters.  They
reward those who already participate in the scheme but promise to
give large rewards to those who join now, at the expense of many
new members who choose to participate later.  Eventually, though,
the supply of new members will slow and end, and the scheme will
collapse.   A large fraction of Albanian citizens invested in
schemes which depended essentially upon the exponential growth
of new participants.   More analysis or mathematical fluency
could have in this case saved considerable death, suffering,
collapse and unhappiness.  Though striking, this example may
seem somewhat distant.  Closer to home, we should think about
widespread participation in ill-advised gambling and lotteries
as some sobering food for thought, as should be the popularity
of such books as "How to Lie with Statistics" and "How to Lie
with Maps."

In political and social settings, a mathematical perspective is
frequently essential.  John Allen Paulos, author of "Innumeracy"
and other popular works about the role of mathematics in modern
society, described the proposed requirement considered recently
by airline regulators.  Out of concern for
the safety of babies in airline accidents, there was a proposal
to require babies to fly in their own seats in a a car seat, to
protect them in the event of a crash.  Currently, children under two
 are
allowed to fly for free in the lap of an adult.  Though this
proposed change would improve the safety of the infant in that
setting, a closer analysis revealed the following likely events-
 if parents were required to pay for a full seat for a flying
baby, the added expense would result in a significant number of
cases when they chose to drive instead.  Driving is considerably
more dangerous than airline travel, and the end result was a
predicted overall increase in infant deaths and injuries. 
Though the ones who chose to fly would indeed be safer, that
improvement would have been more than offset by the increase in
highway injuries and deaths from those who would have driven
principally for financial reasons.  As society continues to
change, relationships become increasingly confusing and complex. 
Computing the "cost" and "benefit" of what seem like
non-mathematical decisions can be tricky and require some comfort
with mathematical arguments.

Not only is mathematical fluency important for society as a
whole, it is important for each individual.  Whether we like it
or it or not, on a daily basis, it is our obligation to convince
those around us that we understand what is going on and that we
are able to solve problems.  Whether we study, teach, sell cars,
write articles, help patients or build houses, our credibility
is constantly on trial.  In order to convince those near us that
we do in fact understand what is going on, we need to be able to
express ourselves clearly and present simple but well-thought out
explanations.  It is not merely our jobs to be understood- if I
say "me hungry banana want", people will probably be able to
figure out what I mean, but their confidence in my ability will
be (understandably) low.  They should regard my conclusions and
opinions with suspicion in the future.

<p>

Mathematics presents a good opportunity for us to work with
logical concepts and construct simple yet persuasive arguments.
Even in the setting of simple mathematical ideas like
arithmetic or geometry, it can take some practice before we are
comfortable expressing our arguments precisely and convincingly.
From this experience, we can learn the art of convincing others
that we understand what is going on- an integral part of every
life, mathematical or not.

<p>

Mathematical literacy is essential for us.  Society needs to be
comfortable with potentially subtle mathematical arguments to
make reasonable decisions that affect us all.  Individually, we
need to be precise and accurate, for which mathematics is an
excellent training ground.  The study of mathematics is hard
work and is not to be taken lightly, but it has its rewards--
for everyone.
