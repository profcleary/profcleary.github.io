    <li> "Edge conflicts do not determine geodesics in the associahedron",
Sean Cleary and Roland Maio
<p> <ul>
There are no known efficient algorithms to calculate distance in the one-skeleta of associahedra, a problem which is equivalent to finding rotation distance between rooted binary trees. One approximate measure of distance in associahedra is the extent to which the edges in the attached triangulations are incompatible, and a natural way of trying to find shortest paths is to maximize locally the number of compatible edges between triangulations. Such steps minimize the number of conflicting edges between these triangulations. We describe examples which show that the number of conflicts does not always decrease along geodesics. Thus, a greedy algorithm which always chooses a transformation which reduces conflicts will not produce a geodesic in all cases. Further, there are examples of increasing size showing that the number of conflicts can increase by any specified amount.

We describe the automorphism groups and the abstract commensurators of Houghton's groups.

As a further consequence, we obtain that the Houghton group on two rays is at least quadratically distorted in those with three or more rays.

   <p> <ul>Edge-flip distance between triangulations of polygons is equivalent to rotation distance between rooted binary trees. Both distances measure the extent of similarity of configurations. There are no known polynomial-time algorithms for computing edge-flip distance. The best known exact universal upper bounds on rotation distance arise from measuring the maximum total va- lence of a vertex in the corresponding triangulation pair obtained by a duality construction. Here we describe some properties of the distribution of maximum vertex valences of pairs of triangulations related to such upper bounds.

We use computational experiments to investigate the statistical characteristics of such a measure of tree similarity for ordered, rooted, binary trees. We generate the trees used in the experiments iteratively, using the Yule process modeled upon speciation.

    <li> "Common edges in rooted trees and polygonal triangulations," (with Andrew Rechnitzer and Thomas Wong), Electronic Journal of Combinatorics. 2013, Vol. 29, #1,<p>
   <p> <ul>Rotation distance between rooted binary trees measures the degree of similarity of two trees with ordered leaves and is
equivalent to edge-flip distance between triangular subdivisions of regular polygons.
There are no known polynomial-time algorithms for computing rotation distance.  Existence of common edges makes computing rotation distance more manageable by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.
 Here we describe the distribution of common edges between randomly-selected triangulations and measure the sizes of the remaining pieces into which the common edges separate the polygons. We find that asymptotically there is a large component remaining after sectioning off numerous small polygons which gives some insight into the distribution of such distances and the difficulty of such distance computations, and we analyze the distributions of the sizes of the largest and smaller resulting polygons.

    <li> "Expected conflicts in pairs of rooted binary trees," (with Timothy Chu), Involve, a journal of mathematics.  2013, Vol. 6<p> <ul>
Rotation distance between rooted binary trees measures the extent of similarity of two trees with ordered leaves. There are no known polynomial-time algorithms for computing rotation distance. If there are common edges or immediately changeable edges between a pair of trees, the rotation distance problem breaks into smaller subproblems. The number of crossings or conflicts of a tree pair also gives some measure of the extent of similarity of two trees. Here we describe the distribution of common edges and immediately changeable edges between randomly-selected pairs of trees via computer experiments, and examine the distribution of the amount of conflicts between such pairs.

    <p> <ul>
We show that the abstract commensurator of Thompson's group F is composed of four building blocks: two isomorphism types of simple groups, the multiplicative group of the positive rationals and a cyclic group of order two.

    <p> <ul>
We describe some of the geometric properties of the automorphism group Aut(F) of Thompson's group F. We give realizations of Aut(F) geometrically via periodic tree pair diagrams, which lead to natural presentations and give effective methods for estimating the word length of elements. We study some natural subgroups of Aut(F) and their metric properties. In particular, we show that the subgroup of inner automorphisms of F is at least quadratically distorted in Aut(F), whereas other subgroups of Aut(F) isomorphic to F are undistorted.

 Sean Cleary, "Tame combing and almost convexity conditions," (with Susan Hermiller, Melanie Stein, and Jennifer Taback) , Mathematische Zeitschrift, 2011, 263,
 <p> <ul>
We give the first examples of groups which admit a tame combing with linear radial tameness function with respect to any choice of finite presentation, but which are not minimally almost convex on a standard generating set. Namely, we explicitly construct such combings for Thompson's group F and the Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(1, p) with p \ge 3. In order to make this construction for Thompson's group F, we significantly expand the understanding of the Cayley complex of this group with respect to the standard finite presentation. In particular we describe a quasigeodesic set of normal forms and combinatorially classify the arrangements of 2-cells adjacent to edges that do not lie on normal form paths.

Metric properties of higher dimensional Thompson's groups, (with Jose Burillo), Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 248, #1 (2010).
<p>
<ul>
Abstract: Higher-dimensional Thompson's groups nV are finitely presented groups described by Brin which generalize dyadic self-maps of the unit interval to dyadic self-maps of n-dimensional unit cubes. We describe some of the metric properties of higher-dimensional Thompson's groups. We give descriptions of elements based upon tree-pair diagrams and give upper and lower bounds for word length in terms of the size of the diagrams. Though these upper and lower bounds are somewhat separated, we show that there are elements realizing the lower bounds and that the fraction of elements which are close to the upper bound converges to 1, showing that the bounds are optimal and that the upper bound is generically achieved.

Random subgroups of Thompson's group F, (with Murray Elder, Andrew Rechnitzer, and Jennifer Taback),  Groups, Geometry and Dynamics, Vol 4, #1, 2010.
<p>
<ul>
Abstract: We consider random subgroups of Thompson's group $F$ with respect to two natural stratifications of the set of all $k$ generator subgroups of this group. We find that the isomorphism classes of subgroups which occur with positive density vary greatly between the two stratifications. We give the first known examples of {\em persistent} subgroups, whose isomorphism classes occur with positive density within the set of $k$-generator subgroups, for all $k$ greater than some $k_0$. Additionally, Thompson's group provides the first example of a group without a generic isomorphism class of subgroup. In $F$, there are many isomorphism classes of subgroups with positive density less than one. Elements of $F$ are represented uniquely by reduced pairs of finite rooted binary trees. We compute the asymptotic growth rate and a generating function for the number of reduced pairs of trees, which we show is D-finite and not algebraic.

Abstract: We determine the abstract commensurator com(F) of Thompson's group F and describe it in terms of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the real line and in terms of tree pair diagrams. We show com (F) is not finitely generated and determine which subgroups of finite index in F are isomorphic to F. We show that the natural map from the commensurator group to the quasi-isometry group of F is injective.

bstract: Braided Thompson's groups are finitely presented groups introduced by Brin and Dehornoy which contain the ordinary braid groups $B_n$, the finitary braid group $B_{\infty}$ and Thompson's group $F$ as subgroups. We describe some of the metric properties of braided Thompson's groups and give upper and lower bounds for word length in terms of the number of strands and the number of crossings in the diagrams used to represent elements.

The authors regret that the published version of this article (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 134(2), pp.343-349, 2006) contains a significant error concerning the model for G described in Section 2. We are grateful to Jorg Lehnert for pointing out our mistake.

We compute the length of an element by constructing a tree pair diagram for the element, classifying the nodes of the tree and summing associated weights from the pairs of node classi¯cations. We use this method to e®ectively ¯nd minimal length representatives of an element.

<ul> 
We describe pure braided versions of Thompson's group F.  These
groups, BF and $\widehat{BF}$, are subgroups of the braided
versions of Thompson's group V, introduced by Brin and Dehornoy.
Unlike V, elements of F are order-preserving self-maps of the
interval and we use pure braids together with elements of F thus
preserving order.  We define these groups and give normal forms
for elements and describe infinite and finite presentations of
these groups.

<p> </p>
<ul>   Rotation distance quantifies the difference in shape between two rooted
binary trees of the same size by counting the minimum number of elementary
changes needed to transform one tree to the other. We describe several types of
rotation distance, and provide upper bounds on distances between trees with a
fixed number of nodes with respect to each type. These bounds are obtained by
relating each restricted rotation distance to the word length of elements of
Thompson's group F with respect to different generating sets, including both
finite and infinite generating sets.

We discuss metric and combinatorial properties of Thompson's group T, such as the normal forms for elements and uniqueness of tree pair diagrams. We relate these properties to those of Thompson's group F when possible, and highlight combinatorial differences between the two groups. We define a set of unique normal forms for elements of T arising from minimal factorizations of elements into convenient pieces. We show that the number of carets in a reduced representative of T estimates the word length, that F is undistorted in T, and that cyclic subgroups of T are undistorted. We show that every element of T has a power which is conjugate to an element of F and describe how to recognize torsion elements in T. <br>

<ul>   We study languages of geodesics in lamplighter groups and Thompson's group F. We show that the lamplighter groups $L_n$ have infinitely many cone types, have no regular geodesic languages, and have 1-counter, context-free and counter geodesic languages with respect to certain generating sets. We show that the full language of geodesics with respect to one generating set for the lamplighter group is not counter but is context-free, while with respect to another generating set the full language of geodesics is counter and context-free. In Thompson's group F, we show there are infinitely many cone types and no regular language of geodesics with respect to the standard finite generating set. We show that the existence of families of ``seesaw'' elements with respect to a given generating set in a finitely generated infinite group precludes a regular language of geodesics and guarantees infinitely many cone types with respect to that generating set.

We explore the geometry of the Cayley graphs of the lamplighter groups and a wide range of wreath products. We show that these groups have dead end elements of arbitrary depth with respect to their natural generating sets. An element $w$ in a group $G$ with finite generating set $X$ is a dead end element if no geodesic ray from the identity to $w$ in the Cayley graph $\Gamma(G,X)$ can be extended past $w$. Additionally, we describe some nonconvex behavior of paths between elements in these Cayley graphs and seesaw words, which are potential obstructions to these graphs satisfying the $k$-fellow traveller property.

 We show that Thompson's group F does not satisfy Cannon's almost convexity

at distance n from the identity and distance 2 from each other, which
are not connected by a path lying inside the n-ball of length less than
k for increasingly large k. Our techniques rely upon Fordham's method
for calculating the length of a word in F and upon an analysis of the
generators' geometric actions on the tree pair diagrams representing elements
of F.<br>

form in the infinite presentation, its word length, and minimal length representatives
of it. We estimate word length in terms of the number and type of carets
in the tree pair diagram and show sharpness of those estimates. In addition
we explore some properties of the Cayley graph of $F$ with respect to the
two generator finite presentation. Namely, we exhibit the form of ``dead
end'' elements in this Cayley graph, and show that it has no ``deep pockets''.
Finally, we discuss a simple method for constructing minimal length representatives
for strictly positive or negative words.<br>

 (Experimental Mathematics, Vol. 13, #4, 2004.) 
 <p> </p>
 <ul>
Parafree groups are groups which closely resemble free groups
yet are not themselves necessarily free.
Parafree groups are groups which are residually nilpotent
and have quotients with the terms in their lower central series which are
isomorphic to the corresponding quotients for a free group.
Several infinite families of parafree groups have been constructed
but there has been no effective means of distinguishing whether
or not groups in these families are isomorphic.  We
attack this problem experimentally, distinguishing some of
them by enumerating homomorphisms to finite groups.

 <p> </p>
 <ul>
We use geometric techniques to investigate several examples of
quasi-isometrically embedded subgroups of Thompson's group F. Many
of these are explored using the metric properties of the shift map
phi in F. These subgroups have simple geometric but complicated
algebraic descriptions. We present them to illustrate the intricate
geometry of Thompson's group F as well as the interplay between its
standard finite and infinite presentations. These subgroups include
those of the form F^m cross Z^n, for integral non-negative m and n,
which were shown to occur as quasi-isometrically embedded subgroups
by Burillo and Guba and Sapir.

 (Information Processing Letters, Vol. 88,  #5,   16 December 2003,   pp. 251--256.) <p><p>
 <ul>
 We obtain a  sharp upper bound
of 4n-8 for restricted rotation distance between two rooted
binary trees with n interior nodes, and a
sharp lower bound of n-2,  with the requirement that the
trees satisfy a reduction condition. These improvements use work
of Fordham
to compute the
word metric in Thompson's group F. <br>

  <li> Restricted Rotation Distance between Binary Trees (Information Processing
Letters, Vol 84, #6,  December 31, 2002)
 <p> </p>
 <ul>
 Restricted rotation distance between pairs of rooted binary trees measures
differences in tree shape and is related to rotation distance. In restricted
rotation distance, the rotations used to transform the trees are allowed
to be only of two types. Restricted rotation distance is larger than rotation
distance, since there are only two permissible locations to rotate, but is
much easier to compute and estimate. We obtain linear upper and lower bounds
for restricted rotation distance in terms of the number of interior nodes
in the trees. Further, we describe a linear-time algorithm for estimating
the restricted rotation distance between two trees and for finding a sequence
of rotations which realizes that estimate. The methods use the metric properties
of the abstract group known as Thompson's group F. <br>

<ul>
We present combinatorial and experimental analyses of 
data requirements for haplotype inference methods.
Biochemical determination of haplotype data in a wet lab
is expensive so computational alternatives, such as the
haplotype inference algorithm developed by Dan Gusfield,
are attractive.
Our experiments include a broad range of problem
sizes under two standard models of tree distribution
and were designed to yield statistically robust results
despite the size of the sample space.  
Our results validate Gusfield's conjecture that a
population size of n log n is required to give 
(with high probability) 
sufficient information to deduce the n haplotypes and their 
complete evolutionary history.  
We support our experimental finding with theoretical
bounds on the population size.
We also analyze  the population size
required to deduce some fixed fraction of the evolutionary 
history of a set of n haplotypes and
establish linear bounds on the required sample size.
These linear bounds are also shown theoretically.

 <li> Metrics and embeddings of generalizations of Thompson's
group F, (with J. Burillo and M. Stein) <br>

 of the AMS</a> Volume 353 (2001), 1677-1689. 
 <p> </p>
 <ul>
 The distance from the origin in the word metric for generalizations F(p)
of Thompson's group F is quasi-isometric to the number of carets in the reduced
rooted tree diagrams representing the elements of F(p). This interpretation
of the metric is used to prove that several types of embeddings of groups
F(p) into each other are quasi-isometric embeddings, and also to study the
behavior of the shift maps under these embeddings. <br>

 In the ring Z[\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}], there is a natural subdivision technique
analogous to regular subdivision in rational algebraic rings like Z[\frac12].
 The properties of this subdivision process are developed using the matrix
associated to the Fibonacci substitution tiling. These properties are applied
 to prove some finiteness properties for a discrete group of piecewise-linear
homeomorphisms.

 <p></p>
 <ul>Let F be the group of piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the
unit interval. F has many interesting countable subgroups, some of which
have cohomological finiteness properties. Many subgroups of piecewise-linear
homeomorphisms with irrational slopes and irrational singularities are finitely
generated, finitely presented and are of type FP_\infty. This is shown by
constructing contractible posets upon which the various subgroups act and
then by understanding the complexity of the classifying space of the poset,
which is an Eilenberg-Maclane space for the subgroup.</p>
