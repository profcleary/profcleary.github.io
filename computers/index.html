    <h1>  Computers and Computation </h1>
    <p>
    <b> Research </b>
    <p>
    I have multiple research projects in computational group theory and metrics on trees motivated
    by computational phylogeny using various computational clusters and workstations.
    These projects include distinguishing members of families of difficult one-relator
    groups, estimating relationships between different metrics on spaces of trees,
    understanding random walks on spaces of trees, and understanding typical
    behavior in groups in the family of Thompson's group F.
   
    
    <p>
    <b> Mathematica </b>
    <p>
    I  use the computer algebra system Mathematica (from <a href="http://www.wolfram.com">Wolfram Research</a>).
  I have written a number  of items as part of an effort to use
    Mathematica in calculus as well as upper division and graduate courses.
    <ul>
    <li> <b> Vector and Multivariate Calculus: Some Mathematica Explorations</b>, Kennel
Press, 1998, 120 pages.<br>
A Mathematica
workbook for multivariate calculus students, with topics ranging from partial
differentiation to Stokes' theorem.   Covers some introductory aspects of the functional
programming of Mathematica.  This text is for Math 77 third-semester multivariate and vector calculus course  at CSUF.
 <p>   <li> <b> Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, and Fourier Series: Mathematica
Workbook for Scientists and Engineers</b>, Kennel Press, 1998, 108 pages. <br>
A collection of Mathematica examples, explanations and exercises covering
topics  including Laplace transform, series solutions to differential
equations, linear dynamical systems, Fourier series, and numerical techniques.
This text is for  Math 81 fourth-semester calculus course  at CSUF, which includes differential equations,
linear systems, Fourier series and other analysis tools useful to scientists and engineers.
  <p>  <li> <b>The Mathematica Mystery Tour</b>
     (with Larry Cusick), Kennel
     Press, 1998, 80 pages.<br>
An introductory book suitable for all calculus students interested in getting
acquainted with symbolic algebra, calculus, plotting and programming
in Mathematica.
<p><li> The CSUF Calculus Mathematica Competency Statement  which
summarizes departmental expectations of students facility with Mathematica in various
courses as well as giving some examples.
    </ul> 
    <p>
    
    <b> Teaching and Outreach</b>
    <p>
    <ul>

    <li> LEGO Mindstorm Robots are a great way to teach introductory programming.  I developed and taught summer courses for talented high school students as part of the <a href="http://cosmos.ucdavis.edu">COSMOS</a> program at UC-Davis. <p>
    <li>
    I taught a wide range of programming and structures courses at UCLA's
    Program in Computing which
    is the UCLA Mathematics Department's program to teach programming and computer
    science to a general audience.
    <p>
    <li> Organizing donations of older computers for schools is a great way of helping
    schools get much appreciated equipment. In Fresno, I worked to
    get unwanted or unused computers available for elementary, secondary and adult education
    programs.  So far, there are more than 600 computers that have been made available as
    part of the program and there are plans for even more.
    </ul>
    
   
    <b> Apple Computers </b>
    <p>
    I have been a longtime user of Apple Computers.
    
    <ul>
 <p>   <li> <a href="duo.html">Powerbook Duo Dock Page</a> with a fix for the dreaded <b> Tick of Death</b><br>
    I am a big fan of Apple's (now long discontinued) line of Duo Powerbooks.
    These Duos are
    very small notebooks which can be inserted (like a tape into into a VCR) into a desktop dock to become
    a desktop machine.  They have the best of both the portable and desktop worlds, and
    are smaller than comparable vintage laptops.  I have acquired a collection of Apple DuoDocks.
    These
    fine products are unfortunately susceptible to the <b>Tick of Death</b> failure
    in which the power supply starts ticking instead of supplying power.  The fix
    for this failure is not too bad and involves soldering a replacement capacitor
    onto the power supply board- I describe this process on the Duo page above.
  <p>  <li> <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">MacBSD/NetBSD</a> <br>
    This is a good free implementation of Unix for older (68k) Macs that runs well on
    IIcx's and IIci's, for example.  One good way of having a constructive, productive semi-retirement
    for  older Macs is to use MacBSD to run them as web servers.
  <p>  <li>LinuxPPC <br>
    There  was a very good implementation of Linux for most PCI PPC macs which is now been supplanted
    since Apple's OS X is a better implementation of a Unix-style environment.    I  worked to get the system set up for the Powerbook G3 Original,
    which can be set up as a dual-boot machine.  A good source of information
    about LinuxPPC was the <a href="http://cobweb.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/jonh/faqomatic/faq.pl">LinuxPPC FAQ-o-Matic</a> to which I have
    contributed solutions about Powerbook G3 Original configuration problems
    as well as ways of using an external HD install on machines with both
    single and dual SCSI busses.  I  did highly reccommend <a href="http://calvaweb.calvacom.fr/bh40/">
    Benjamin Herrenschmidt's page</a> which contained BootX, a very useful tool which dramatically
    simplifies LinuxPPC installation and booting, for which I worked as a beta-tester.
    </ul>
    
    
    <b> Unix, NeXTs and mh</b>
    <p>
    <ul>
  <p>  <li> The CSUF department had a 30 station lab<
    of NeXTs which we had been very
    happy with and gotten great mileage from as instructional machines running
    Mathematica.
    <p>
 <p>  <li>
    I was a longtime fan of <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/mh-faq/top.html">mh</a> an excellent
    mail handler for Unix.  The old man page for mh had a subtitle something like
    "How to get 100 mail messages a day and still get work done" at a time (1989) when getting
    a 100 email messages a day seemed preposterous...   The package mh is a scriptable collection
    of commands and
    if you want to compile it for the (somewhat nonstandard) Unix on NeXTs,
    <a href="mailto:sean_cleary@csufresno.eduhahadoesntwork">send me mail</a> for some benevolent wisdom.
  <p>  <li> The various successes of networked Linux boxes in the <a href="http://www.beowulf.org">Beowulf</a>
    projects are exciting and our Wildebeest cluster is an implementation of a large number of
    commodity-grade, tested and simply configured Linux boxes.
   </ul>
   
   <b> Software Developed </b>
    <p>
    I have written several commerically successful software packages, the
    most notable of which are the statistical software package by a company which
 I founded in 1981, and less notable of which included numerous games, utilities,
and encryption tools.
